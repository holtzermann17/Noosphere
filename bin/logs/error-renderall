<p><b>Caspar NEUMANN</b><br />
b. 14 September 1648 - d. 27 January 1715<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> The data of Pastor Caspar Neumann on births and funerals in Breslau were used in the preparation of the first mortality table.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Caspar Neumann was born shortly before the end of the Thirty Years' War in the Silesian town of Breslau (now Wroclaw, in Poland), where his father was a merchant and, later on, tax collector. After his father's early death, Neumann first became an apprentice in a chemist's shop, but then enrolled at Jena University in the Autumn 1667, holding a scholarship from the city of Breslau for the study of Protestant theology, following his father's wish. In only three years he achieved an <i>Magister artum liberalium</i> degree, and gave lectures on philosophy and rhetoric. In accordance with the prevailing taste of the century, his funeral orations were in particular taken notice of, and later published in book form. Herzog (Duke) Ernest I the Pious of Sachsen-Gotha-Altenburg appointed him travelling preacher and attendant to Crown Prince Christian on a tour through Southern Germany, Switzerland, Upper Italy, and Southern France. In 1676 Neumann was appointed Court Chaplain of Altenburg. Two years later he married Johanne Susanne Adelheid Raabe, the daughter of the personal physician to the duke.</p>
<p>Out of gratitude to his native town he accepted a call as pastor at St Magdalen's church in Breslau. There his son and first wife died, and in May 1684 he married Christiane Greiff, a merchant's daughter who bore him eight children. The functions of the office of pastor at St Elisabeth's church, entrusted to him in 1697, included superintendence over all churches and schools of Breslau, as well as the first theological professorship at both municipal grammar schools. Neumann enjoyed high public esteem as the editor of a widely used prayer-book, as an author of religious hymns, and as a highly respected preacher and Hebrew scholar. Indeed, he is often described as an orientalist in library catalogues. As well as these accomplishments, he pursued mathematical, astronomical, and botanical studies. In 1706 he was elected to the Berlin Academy of Sciences. Highly honoured, he died in Breslau.</p>
<p>Caspar Neumann earned lasting recognition in the field of population statistics. He was the first to try to apply strict inductive analysis and exact observation to the phenomena of human life, in close analogy to the methodology of the emerging natural sciences. Being a theologian himself, his ideas had religious roots. Above all, he objected to the prevailing opinion of his time that human birth and death are determined by the position of the planets and comets, or governed by magic numbers. His scientific interest was thus primarily aimed at finding predictable regularities in the deaths of human beings. For this reason he prepared in the years 1687 to 1691 elaborately compiled tables on births and funerals in the Protestant parishes of Breslau. In preparing this work he was supported by the physician Dr Gottfried Schultz and the mayor Johann Sigismund von Haunold, both of whom were interested in these statistical studies.</p>
<p>While still engaged in compiling the tables, Caspar Neumann sent a copy of his <i>Reflectiones über Leben und Tod bei denen in Breslau Geborenen und Gestorbenen (Reflections on Life and Death according to Births and Deaths in Breslau)</i> to the polymath and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, with whom he had had a lively correspondence for some time. Referring to his own studies, Neumann remarked that he did not yet perceive their utility, but expected that “schöne Anmerkungen göttlicher Provenienz über unser Leben und Tod" (“a beautiful commentary on Divine Providence in our life and death") could be made if such statistical data were generally collected.</p>
<p>The Royal Society of London, founded in 1660 for the development of science, was evidently informed by Leibniz of Neumann's work. The need for such data had been seen in England by <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=44" name="menu0">John Graunt</a> (q.v.) and Sir William Petty (1623-1687). In a letter of invitation for correspondence the Society's secretary Henry Justell, a religious refugee from France, asked Neumann to send him the tables of the births and funerals of the city of Breslau. Neumann granted his request by sending the tables for the years 1687 - 1690 in a letter on January 31, 1692. In response, Justell wrote a letter to Neumann dated October 7, 1692, in which Justell advised that he found the tables very useful, and that they accurately contained everything one wishes to find in them. A separate correspondence between Leibniz and Justell on Neumann's work also took place between the dates of these letters.</p>
<p>The Pastor of Breslau wrote again to the Royal Society on December 9, 1692, and provided at the same time the data for the year 1691 that again were precisely detailed according to age, sex, cause of death, etc. Justell, who had had close contacts with the most distinguished scholars of his age, died on September 25, 1693, in London without having seen the further influence of Neumann's statistical data. The letter of Caspar Neumann was read out at the session of the Royal Society on November 22, 1693, and the statistical material was committed for further analysis to its member, the astronomer Edmond Halley (1656-1742), after whom the well-known comet is named.</p>
<p>Neumann's scientific attainments consisted in providing the empirical basis of population statistics that was later used by Halley for the preparation of the first scientific mortality tables. In 1694 Halley's work was published in volume 17 of the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for the year 1693, on page 596 with the title <i>An estimate of the degree of the Mortality of Mankind, drawn from curious Tables of the Births and Funerals of the city of Breslaw; with an attempt to ascertain the price of Annuities upon Lives</i>. In this treatise three mortality tables were presented, together with related calculations of the annuities upon lives. Table I contained the years of life the departed had reached in absolute figures, Table II the number of deaths reaching the age referred to, and Table III the number of living persons reaching this age. Halley considered Neumann's data particularly well suited for this purpose, because Breslau as a rural town with practically no immigration or emigration, had a statistically stationary population. Halley's mortality tables were a prerequisite for the development of modern life insurance on a mathematical/statistical basis in England. Neumann and Halley also corresponded directly. His letter to Halley of March 1, 1694, clearly indicates that he was aware of having delivered useful statistical material, and Halley himself wrote of the “doctus” (“learned") Dr Neumann with words of gratitude and appreciation calling him the collector of valuable statistical data. The efforts of Dr Johann Graetzer, physician in Breslau, supported by the professors Ferdinand Cohn and Burden Sanderson, finally led to the rediscovery of Neumann's letters in the archives of the Royal Society in London at the end of the 19th century. Some are reproduced in English in Pearson (1978).<br />

<p><b>Jerzy NEYMAN</b><br />
b. 16 April 1894 - d. 5 August 1981<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Neyman was one of the towering figures in the rise of 20th century mathematical statistics, contributing to the theory of statistical experimentation and sample surveys, but especially to the development of the formal theory of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a> and confidence intervals.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Jerzy Neyman was born of Polish parents in 1894, in Bendery, which has been variously labeled as Rumania, Ukraine, and Moldavia because of the vicissitudes of border-drawing in Eastern Europe. From 1912 to 1917 he studied mathematics at the University of Kharkov, where he went on to receive a Masters degree in 1920 and then became a lecturer. In the summer of 1921, Neyman went to Bydgoszcz in northern Poland, as part of an exchange of nationals between Russia and Poland agreed to at the end of the Russian-Polish War. There he worked as “senior statistical assistant” at the National Agricultural Institute and he wrote two long papers on agricultural experimentation that were published in 1923 in Polish (Splawa-Neyman, 1990 [1923a], 1925 [1923b]).</p>
<p>In 1924, Neyman obtained his doctorate degree from the University of Warsaw, using as a thesis the work done in Bydgoszcz. The papers prepared during his time at the National Agricultural Institute led to Neyman's later contributions to experimental design (see Neyman et al. 1935) and especially sampling (Neyman, 1934) but were also responsible in part for Neyman's 1925 visit to University College London, to work in <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu1">Karl Pearson</a>'s (q.v.) Laboratory.</p>
<p>There Neyman began a decade-long collaboration with Pearson's son, Egon (q.v.), a collaboration which yielded the formal theory of tests of hypotheses and also led to Neyman's subsequent invention of confidence intervals. We describe some these contributions in more detail in subsequent sections.</p>
<p>By 1934, after holding various teaching and research positions in Poland, Neyman moved to England to join Egon Pearson at University College as a Senior Lecturer and then Reader. In 1937, at the invitation of W. Edwards Deming (q.v.), Neyman made a six-week visit to the United States where he lectured on sampling at the U. S. Department of Agriculture Graduate School (e.g., see Neyman, 1952 for a revised version of these lectures) and at several universities. This visit ultimately led to an offer for Neyman to join the University of California at Berkeley where he ultimately established a leading department of mathematical statistics. Here he institutionalized the now famous Berkeley Symposia on Statistics and Probability, gathering together the world's leading mathematical statisticians every five years from 1945 to 1970.</p>
<p>Throughout his Berkeley years, problems related to the war effort, to medicine, to weather modification, and to astronomy offered Neyman practical applications which inspired theoretical development. Neyman worked closely with students, supervising almost 40 Ph.D. dissertations at Berkeley. He continued to work at Berkeley until his retirement in 1961, and he remained an active participant in the department until his death on August 5, 1981.</p>
<p>Neyman had always had scientific interests much broader than narrowly construed mathematical statistics; as noted above, he constantly used practical problems as springboards to theoretical advances. But his interests extended to the practical issues of formation of statistical societies (he was a prime mover in the establishment of the Bernoulli Society as a section of the International Statistical Institute) and to science well beyond statistics. Before coming to the United States he had helped commemorate the 450th anniversary of Copernicus' birth. In 1973 he helped mark Copernicus' 500th anniversary by organizing and editing a volume about modern-day Copernican revolutions entitled <em>The Heritage of Copernicus: Theories "Pleasing to the Mind."</em></p>
<p>Neyman received many honors, including the Guy Medal in Gold from the Royal Statistical Society and numerous honorary degrees. He was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States and as a foreign member of the Swedish and Polish Academies of Science and of the Royal Society. For detailed biographical material on Neyman, see Lehmann (1994) and especially Reid (1982).<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Neyman on Experimentation and Sampling</b></p>
<p>While Neyman is perhaps best known today for his contributions to sampling theory and for a system of inference, his earliest published work concerned the design of experiments. The parallels between the design elements of sampling and experimentation are obvious in Neyman's 1923 paper on experimental design. He conceptualized the assignment of treatments to units in an experiment as the drawing without replacement of balls from urns, one urn for each treatment. These urns had the special property that the removal of a ball (representing the outcome of an experimental unit) from one urn causes it to disappear from the other urns as well. Thus Neyman showed that when there is a finite pool of experimental units that need to be assigned to treatments, the random assignment of units to treatments is exactly parallel to the random selection of a sample from a finite population. Neyman was to take up the issues in experimentation again in a controversial 1935 paper on Latin square designs read before the Royal Statistical Society. This work provoked a major dispute with R. A.. Fisher (q.v.) (see Fienberg and Tanur (1996) for further details.</p>
<p>During the 1920s there was much discussion of “the method of representative sampling” at the meetings of the International Statistical Institute (ISI), leading to a committee report which contained a description of two such methods, random sampling (with all elements of the populations having the same probability of selection), and purposive selection of large groups of units (in modern terminology, clusters), chosen to match the population on selected control variates. Although the ISI report did not attempt to choose between the methods, Gini (q.v.) and Galvani subsequently presented a major application of purposive selection to the sampling of records from the 1921 Italian census, in which they called into question the accuracy of random sampling.</p>
<p>Neyman responded with his classic 1934 paper, in which he compared purposive and random sampling, but also offered elements of synthesis. He began by describing stratified sampling, noting that earlier work by Bowley (q.v.) considered only the proportionate case. He then gave a crisp description of cluster sampling explaining that the difficulties in sampling individuals at random may be greatly diminished when we adopt groups as the elements of sampling. In this new synthesis, he called this procedure “random sampling by groups.” He then suggested combining stratification with clustering to form “random stratified sampling by groups.”</p>
<p>The paper also contains a derivation of optimal allocation for stratification, still known as Neyman allocation despite the later discovery of an earlier proof by Chuprov (q.v.). But perhaps the most notable feature of the paper at the time was Neyman's introduction of confidence intervals.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>The Neyman-Pearson Collaboration</b></p>
<p>During the same period of time, Neyman entered into a collaboration with Egon Pearson, which was to have a profound impact on the direction both of mathematical statistics and statistical practice for the rest of the 20th century. Between 1926 and 1933, in response to what they viewed as Fisher's ad hoc approach to testing, they developed what we now know as the Neyman-Pearson theory of hypothesis testing, which identifies an alternative hypothesis and recognizes two types of error. Their approach focused on the power to detect alternative hypotheses and led to the identification of optimal test criteria in specific circumstances. It was to serve as the foundation of much later work in mathematical statistics.</p>
<p>This work on testing also led Neyman to formulate his theory of statistical estimation via the method of confidence intervals, first introduced with limited details in the 1934 sampling paper. As Neyman developed these ideas further in a 1937 paper, he linked the basic structure of tests and interval estimation in a fashion that allowed the carry-over of the Neyman-Pearson optimality results. The frequentist, repeated sampling interpretation of confidence intervals remains difficult for many practicing scientists to comprehend.</p>
<p>Neyman continued to work on testing and estimation problems throughout his career and later developed an alternative to the Pearson chi-square goodness-of-fit test, as well as the <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ C(\alpha)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/77/l2h/img1.png" title="$ C(\alpha)$" width="46" /></span> family of test criteria, and, in 1949, he used linearization methods to develop best asymptotically normal (BAN) estimates.<br />

<p><b>Richard von MISES</b><br />
b. 19 April 1883 - d. 14 July 1953<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Von Mises was principally known for his work on the foundations of probability and statistics (randomness) which was rehabilitated in the 1960s. He founded a school of applied mathematics in Berlin and wrote the first text book on philosophical positivism in 1939.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>As the Swedish probabilist Harald Cramér (q.v.) once put it sensitively, Richard von Mises was one of those men who have both the ability and the energy requisite for taking an active and creative interest in many widely different fields. He has made outstanding contributions to subjects as heterogeneous as literary criticism, positivistic philosophy, aerodynamics, and stochastics [Cramer (1953), 657]. Richard von Mises was born in Lemberg (now Lwiw, Ukraine) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the second of three brothers; the eldest, Ludwig, became an economist of international reputation. His father, Arthur von Mises, was a prominent railroad engineer in the civil service. Both parents were Jewish; his mother Adele was a nee Landau. Richard von Mises converted to Catholicism shortly before World War I but became an agnostic rather soon [Goldstein (1963), ix]. The family home was in Vienna, were Richard went to school and studied mechanical engineering at the Technical University until 1906. He became an assistant to the professor of mechanics, Georg Hamel, in Bruenn (now Brno, Czech Republic), were he obtained the venia legendi(Privatdozentur) in 1908. After only one year (at the age of 26), von Mises was called to the University of Strassburg as associate professor of applied mathematics, the field he made famous [Geiringer (1968), 382]. During World War I, von Mises joined the newly formed Flying Corps of the Austro-Hungarian Army (he had already a pilot's licence). The lectures on the theory of flight which he gave to German and Austrian officers constituted the first version of his Fluglehre of 1918, which went through many editions. At the end of the war, von Mises could not return to the now French Strasbourg. After short appointments in Frankfurt and Dresden, he became director of the new Institute for Applied Mathematics at the University of Berlin in 1920. Almost all papers by von Mises on probability and statistics are from the second part of his career. At the time of von Mises' two seminal papers "Fundamental Theorems of Probability" and "The Foundations of Probability" in the <i>Mathematische Zeitschrift</i> of 1919 [Von Mises, Selecta II] the conceptual foundations of probability were still obscure. Von Mises' was unsatisfied with the “classical" definition of probability by Laplace (q.v.), based on the famous “equally possible cases" and perpetuated by his former teacher in Vienna, E. Czuber. There were, however, traditions within logics, psychology, philosophy, and statistics (J. Venn (q.v.), G. Fechner (q.v.), G. Helm, H. Bruns) to equate the probability of an event with the relative frequency of the event “in the long run". Richard von Mises, in his “Foundations", drew on these traditions, and borrowed the name “Kollektiv" from psychologist <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=32" name="menu0">Gustav Theodor Fechner</a>'s “Kollektivmasslehre" (1897). Von Mises' concept of a collective, the definition of mathematical probability as the limit of a frequency ratio, and the two fundamental postulates, requiring the existence of the limiting values of the relevant frequencies, and their invariance under any place selection independent from the outcomes of the events, were soon to become familiar to all probabilists. In his “Foundations" he urged that “probability is a science of the same kind as geometry and theoretical mechanics ... which aims to reproduce observable phenomena not just as a reproduction of reality but rather as its abstraction and idealisation" [Von Mises, Selecta II, 58]. Thus, Richard von Mises ran into the fundamental philosophical and practical problems of the application of mathematics to reality, which he tried to address on a general level at about the same time in his programmatic paper on the “aims of applied mathematics" [Von Mises, Selecta II, 454 ff.] in the first volume of the <i>Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik</i> (ZAMM), founded by him in 1921. In fact, one fundamental objection against von Mises' axiomatics of probability was, that the very existence of a collective could not be proven in a strict mathematical sense, since the requirement of the irregularity (randomness) of the collective precluded mathematical rules for its construction. In his book <i>Probability, Statistics, and Truth</i>, first published in German in 1928 and intended for nonmathematical readers, von Mises replied to various criticisms, and gave his comments on alternative systems proposed by others. Von Mises' position towards the foundations of probability was intimately connected to his philosophical positivism. Von Mises did not believe that statistical explanations in physics - and other domains of knowledge - are of transient utility while deterministic theories are the definite goal. Philosophers, von Mises thought, are apt to “eternalize" the current state of scientific affairs, just as Kant held Euclidean space as an absolute category. In contrast with these “school philosophers," he called himself a “positivist" [Geiringer (1968), 384]. In 1939 von Mises published an influential monograph on Positivism. Later editions of <i>Probability, Statistics, and Truth</i> have a chapter with the expressive title “A part of the theory of sets? No!", which is explicitely directed against A.N.Kolmogorov's measure-theoretic approach to probability. In a sense, the conflict between von Mises and his enthusiastic and critical followers (J. Neyman (q.v.), A. Wald) and Kolmogorov was a difference in perspective, and one of the principle merits of von Mises' approach was the historical influence on sharpening the opposing standpoints. Mises pointed to the practical problems of finding the appropriate “collective" for a given statistical situation, warned against misinterpretations of statistical data and stressed the importance of Bayes' theorem (while strictly sticking to an “objective" interpretation of probability) as opposed to “fiducial probability", “maximum likelihood" and similar concepts in statistics. However, von Mises' insistence on the “collectives", especially on the infinity of events, prevented him from acknowledging the relative merits of approaches such as “small sample theory". More in the tradition of his first paper of 1919, the “Fundamentalsaetze", which deals mainly with the central limit theorem, are Richard von Mises' various single contributions to the theory and application of mathematical statistics. For the most part his results are collected in his book of 1931, which was, however, supplemented by later work on what he called “statistical functions" and on a differential calculus of asymptotic distributions. Among his earlier publications were the (S.N.) Bernstein-von -Mises theorem on (Bayesian) statistical inference and the Cramér - von-Mises-<a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">test</a> in non-parametrical statistics, as well as important work on the statistical estimation of moments and expectation [Witting (1990), pp. 792-93]. As to the foundations of probability there is no doubt that Kolmogorov's approach had mathematical advantages in developing the theories of stochastic processes, martingales, even risk theory. But it was in a strange twist of events that von Mises foundation of probability proved fruitful again in the 1960s. It was Kolmogrov himself who wrote in a seminal paper on the algorithmic approach to information theory in 1963: “I have already expressed the view ... that the basis for the applicability of the results of the mathematical theory of probability to real `random phenomena' must depend on some form of the frequency concept of probability, the unavoidable nature of which has been established by von Mises in a spirited manner" [Uspensky (1989), p. 57]. Kolmogorov “was interested in the precise nature of the transition from chaotic sequences, which have no apparent regularities, to random sequences, which exhibit statistical regularities and and form the domain of probability theory proper" [Lambalgen (1987), p. 734]. Kolmogorov's concept of chaoticness was further developed by L. Levin and C.-P. Schnorr. The papers by Kolmogorov and others showed, firstly, that statistical regularities in von Mises' sense are not `simple', that is, they do not lead to a significant decrease in complexity. Secondly, Mises' approach gives an opportunity to use substantially the notion of an algorithm. That opportunity was taken by A. Church and Kolmogorov. Thus, the notion of complexity within information theory, due to A.N. Kolmogorov in the early 1960s, with its attendant complexity-based definition of randomness, is the most important development issuing from von Mises' attempt to define Kollektivs.</p>
<p>Given von Mises' biography as a former professor in Strassburg and as a pilot in the war it is understandable that he harboured strong political feelings against the treaty of Versailles (1919) and the treatment of Germans and Austrians after World War I. He became skeptical of international scientific communication altogether and opposed aerodynamicist Theodor von Karman's efforts to organize an international congress for applied mechanics in 1922 with the following words: “You will not be surprised by the fact that I will not come, since my views about Tyrol and the Italians are well known to you... Furthermore I am a bit surprised at seeing that German professors feel the need to communicate abroad their theoretical researches on flight, while we are at the same time prevented from building real airplanes" [Battimelli (1988), 10]. On the other hand, philosophically, he did not belong to the mainstream of German academe, even not to the scientific part of it. His contacts to the Wiener Kreis and its Berlin branch Gesellschaft für Empirische Philosophie in the late 1920s as well as his insistence on the values of applied mathematics as opposed to the governing purism in mathematics set him at variance with more conservative and more nationalist colleagues in Berlin (L. Bieberbach, E. Schmidt). At the University of Berlin he had to fight for the teaching permit to be awarded to his assistant and later wife Hilda Geiringer [cf. Siegmund-Schultze (1993)]. Von Mises' colleagues never proposed his election as a member of the leading Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, pointing to “blunders" in his work as in the axiomatics of probability, work which, as indicated above, proved far-sighted much later. When von Mises had to leave Germany as a Jew in 1933, his feeling of responsibility for the future of applied mathematics in Germany bordered on self-denial. He proposed the Nazi Theodor Vahlen as his successor as director of the Institute for Applied Mathematics and supported young “Aryan" mathematicians to fill the vacated positions [Mises Papers Harvard]. Von Mises left for Istanbul (Turkey) where he built another Institute for Applied Mathematics, before he felt the need to flee, once again, in 1939. Von Mises went to the United States where he became Gordon McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University in 1944. There he founded, together with von Karman, the <i>Advances in Applied Mechanics</i> (since 1948). His career in the United States was successful, if not without the usual struggles for the recognition of applied mathematics. One of his colleagues called it a scandal that von Mises was not elected to the National Academy of Sciences [Ludford (1983), 282]. When von Mises was finally proposed in 1950 as a member of the former Prussian Academy, which had become meanwhile the leading Academy in East Germany, he declined with the following words: “In the present circumstances ... the election could be interpreted and has been interpreted as having definite political implications. I made it a principle throughout my life to abstain from any kind of political activity and never to join any association or group concerned with matters of a political nature. Consequently, I feel compelled to desist from accepting the membership generously offered to me." [Mises Papers Harvard] That von Mises would indeed always abstain from active and organized political engagement, has to be understood in the context of his individualistic, elitist world view. The latter was intimately connected with the peculiarities of his biography as a repeatedly uprooted and wandering, socially well-to-do intellectual from the lower Austrian nobility. His world-view was reflected in von Mises' admiration of his countryman, the elitist and world-weary poet Rainer Maria Rilke, of whom he became a noted specialist (Von Mises' Rilke collection is now in the possession of Houghton Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts). Thus, von Mises was considered “truly aristocratic, seeming proud and haughty to many" [Goldstein (1963), xiii]. However, his conduct in many difficult situations, not least when he sent CARE-parcels to colleagues in Europe after World War II, showed what compassionate and loyal a human being he actually was.<br />

<p><b>Florence NIGHTINGALE</b><br />
b. 12 May 1820 - d. 13 August 1910<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Nightingale - a "Passionate Statistician" rather than "Lady with the Lamp" - was driven by the scandalous legacy of the Crimean War to use statistical weapons in her fight for hospital reform.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>To most of her contemporaries, as to later generations, Florence Nightingale (FN for short) was the “Lady with the Lamp”. However, it was not her lamp but her pen, combined with administrative skill and political influence, that FN wielded so effectively - both in the Crimean War and in her later battles with officialdom, in the cause of army hospital reform and other sanitary concerns. In this work, she wholeheartedly embraced, as a weapon, the new tool of statistics that became available in the nineteenth century - and with such conviction as to be labelled the “Passionate Statistician”.</p>
<p>In her 'teens, FN had demanded tuition in mathematics, which she followed with much self-education. Her interest in statistics stemmed from an intense concern with public health and hospitals, manifested well before her first appointment.</p>
<p>Her work in the Crimea does not need retelling. Back in England in 1856, she rejected the role of heroine for that of a practical-minded empiricist, determined to exploit facts and figures in her various campaigns. In this, FN relied heavily on the advice of leading statisticians, especially the registrar-general's officer <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=31" name="menu0">William Farr</a>.</p>
<p>Her goal was always the winning of the argument - her method was that of overwhelmingly effective communication. In her collaboration with Farr over two decades, her singular contribution was a flair for publicising their statistical findings through the use of diagrams - “to affect thro' the Eyes what we may fail to convey to the brains of the public through their word-proof ears”.</p>
<p>In the controversy that followed a Royal Commission on the sanitary scandals of the Crimean War, she invented what are now widely referred to as FN's “coxcombs”. The one here reproduced is from her 1858 <em>Notes on Matters affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army</em>.</p>
<div align="center"><a name="44"></a>

</table>
</div>
<p>It shows the progression of the death rates from wounds (red), “preventible disease” (blue) and other causes (black). The legend is careful to explain that “the Areas of the blue, red <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \&amp;$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/78/l2h/img2.png" title="$ \&amp;$" width="19" /></span> black wedges are each measured from the centre as the common vertex”. Correcting an earlier misleading graphical representation, FN has here made a square-root transformation - by requiring the areas, not the lengths, of the sectors to be proportional to the death rates. In a lecture for the Florence Nightingale Museum, Hugh Small has observed that, in her use of the term “coxcomb”, FN was not referring to such diagrams but, with greater thoughtfulness, to the whole document of which they might form part, such as the colourful attention-getting annex she had earlier attached to the Report of the Royal Commission. If we are to respect FN's subtlety in this matter, perhaps we should adopt David Spiegelhalter's description of the diagrams as “polar area charts”.</p>
<p>At times, FN's concern with the effectiveness of presentation disturbed Farr, who expressed the fear that, in her search for an audience, his colleague sometimes went beyond good statistical method. He even wrote to tell that</p>
<blockquote>We do not want impressions. We want facts <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \ldots$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/78/l2h/img3.png" title="$ \ldots$" width="27" /></span> Again I must repeat my objections to intermingling Causation with Statistics <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \ldots$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/78/l2h/img4.png" title="$ \ldots$" width="27" /></span> The statisticians has nothing to do with causation; he is almost certain in the present state of knowledge to err <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \ldots$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/78/l2h/img5.png" title="$ \ldots$" width="27" /></span> You complain that your report would be dry. The dryer the better. Statistics should be the driest of all reading; what I complain of is that on reading your report I am conscious of receiving a wrong impression, because your details are not sufficiently dry and sufficiently extensive.</blockquote>
<p>FN cannot have been moved much by this appeal. Interest in causes and their uncovering lay at the heart of her activities. Hugh Small's book is almost a statistical whodunnit, as it documents the story that comes from FN's revolutionary statistical demonstration, after six months of careful investigation, that the principal cause of the frightful mortality of the Crimean soldiers in her charge was not their poor, half-starved condition on admission, but the filthy state of the hospital itself-a state of affairs hitherto regarded as inevitable in hospitals! Small makes the case that it was FN's overwhelming sense of statistical guilt-when, alas too late, she uncovered the truth with William Farr's help-that triggered the physical collapse that has puzzled her biographers. Fortunately, her interest in the dispassionate analysis of causes revived. Her 1860 International Statistical Congress scheme for uniform hospital statistics was driven by an interest in causes of sickness and mortality. In her 1863 <em>Notes on Hospitals</em>, she wrote that the current method of estimating mortality (without reference to age, sex, type of operation or post-operative complications)</p>
<blockquote>“can at best lead to very loose approximations. It can convey but a very imperfect idea of the real state of the case. And one thing is quite certain, that it can lead to no practical result whatever, either as regards the true causes of the mortality, or how these might be mitigated.”</blockquote>
<p>The same command of the statistical highground is evidenced in her 1871 <em>Introductory Notes on Lying-In Institution</em> - a publication that led to the saving of many mothers' lives at childbirth. In 1872, FN sent a copy of this book to the Belgian statistician Quetelet, whom she had met at the 1860 International Statistical Congress. She received in return the two volumes of Quetelet's 1969 <em>Physique Sociale</em> and the companion work <em>L'Anthropometrie</em>. Of <em>Physique Sociale</em>, she told Farr that she was</p>
<blockquote>astounded at the force of genius and accurate observation which has produced such a work.</blockquote>
<p>This is borne out by many notes that FN made in the margins of <em>Physique Sociale</em>, and that are now reproduced in Diamond <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \&amp;$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/78/l2h/img6.png" title="$ \&amp;$" width="19" /></span> Stone (1981). In Quetelet's work she found expression of the “laws of moral statistics”, which for her became the “very highest kind of religion”. She saw Quetelet as<br />
<small class="SMALL">the founder of the most important science in the whole world: for upon it depends the practical application of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \ldots$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/78/l2h/img7.png" title="$ \ldots$" width="27" /></span> every other Art: the one Science essential to all Political <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \&amp;$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/78/l2h/img8.png" title="$ \&amp;$" width="19" /></span> Social Administration, all Education <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \&amp;$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/78/l2h/img9.png" title="$ \&amp;$" width="19" /></span> Organisation based on experience. For it only gives exact results of our experience.</small></p>
<p>Her enthusiasm for Quetelet was possible only because Quetelet made his excursions into pure theory a very small part of his writings. Her distaste for theoretical “research” surfaced when she withdrew her offer of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \pounds 2000$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/78/l2h/img10.png" title="$ \pounds 2000$" width="57" /></span> to the research-minded <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=38" name="menu1">Francis Galton</a> for the endowment of a chair of Applied Statistics at Oxford. There is little to indicate that she understood the statistical theory available to her, or that she cared in the least about it. Her interests, even when overlaid with a mystical concern with God's laws, were not academic (in the worst sense) but practical, and it is as an advocate of the practical application of statistics that she deserves to be noticed by statisticians today.</p>
<p>However, it is a moot question whether any statistician today, especially one working for some organisation with little or even negative social concern, can take much heart or instruction from FN's example - even though there are many ethical statistical battles to be fought both within and outside such organisations. FN was helped in her statistical work by a “starting capital” that made her unique - family connections, financial independence, and, dwarfing all else, the prodigious public support she acquired during the Crimean War. Nonetheless, FN's involvement with statistics was marked by qualities that were not bought with her starting capital, and that will always repay emulation - qualities of persistence, intellectual passion, and (<em>pace</em> the critic F.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Smith) a manifest inner integrity. She was one who found statistics “more enlivening than a novel” and loved to “bite on a hard fact”. When Farr told her he had a New Year's gift for her “in the shape of Tables”, she replied that she was “exceedingly anxious to see your charming Gift, especially those returns showing the Deaths, Admissions, Diseases”. An eye-witness claimed that, however exhausted Florence might be, the sight of long columns of figures was “perfectly reviving” to her.<br />

<p><b>Anton MEYER</b><br />
b. 31 May 1801 - 29 April 1857<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Meyer, a Belgian professor of Luxemburg origin, was the author of one of the few treatises of probability theory in the 19th century. He propagated the methods of Gauss, Bessel and Baeyer among geodesists of the French tradition.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Anton Meyer was born in Luxemburg, but became a naturalised Belgian on 2 April 1839. Although from a family of modest means (his father was a shoemaker), he completed his secondary schooling in the humanities in 1818, and then pursued his scientific studies with brilliance at Liège University. During this period, in order to earn a living, he taught and also catalogued the scientific books at the University's academic library. He worked towards a doctor's degree in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences, completing his thesis on “Maxima and minima" on 29 November 1823, though his defence only took place on 16 June 1832. In 1824-25, Meyer travelled to Paris to listen to the eminent scientists of the day. On his return to Belgium, he taught at the Echternach College and later at the Military School of Bréda. In 1827, he published a paper in Quetelet's (q.v.) <i>La correspondance mathématique et physique</i>, about an instrument he had invented for drawing in perspective. In 1831 he taught at the Louvain College, and later from 1832 to 1837 at the Institut Gaggia in Brussels, where he prepared students for the Military School.</p>
<p>In 1834, he also became Professor of Analysis and Mechanics at the Brussels Military School, which had just opened, but he resigned from this position in 1836. In 1838, he was appointed to the Chair of Mathematical Analysis at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, and later he replaced Lemaire in the Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus, Higher Analysis and Calculus of Probabilities at Liège University from 1849 until his death. Under Meyer, two distinct subjects were taught, analysis, and probability theory and political arithmetic.</p>
<p>Meyer was clearly a dedicated teacher: his lessons, according to the reports of his pupils, were very appealing. After 1838, having achieved a stable position, he wrote a dozen text books. These were original, and written in simple and precise language; furthermore, Meyer was quick and accurate in his calculations, which were carried out with great ability. His lectures on probability were published only many years after his death, in 1874 by F. Folie, based on the author's manuscripts, as the <i>Cours de Calcul des Probabilités fait à l'Université de Liège de 1849 à 1857</i> (F. Hayez, Bruxelles). This work, given the relative dearth of treatises on probability at the time, created something of a stir, and was translated into German in 1879 by E. Czuber under the title <i>Vorlesungen über Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung</i>. It contains a thoroughly researched account of the theory of errors. In the preface, F. Folie points out: “This book by Meyer is a very complete summary of the most important works of Bernoulli (q.v), de Moivre (q.v.), Laplace (q.v.), Poisson (q.v.), Gauss (q.v.), Encke, Bienaymé (q.v.)... on the calculus of probabilities. One might well suggest that there does not exist a broader treatise on the subject, except for Laplace's <i>Théorie analytique des probabilités</i> ...".</p>
<p>The treatise is very theoretical, even in his chapters concerned with the theory of errors, concentrating essentially on his proofs. This is in contrast to J.B.J. Liagre (1815-1891), who, in his <i>Calcul des probabilités et théorie des erreurs</i> published in 1852, gave a large number of applications of the theory of errors, particularly in geodesy.</p>
<p>Meyer was nevertheless interested in applications of mathematics, most particularly to geodesy. In 1835, while he was at the Military School in Brussels, Meyer's colleagues were Quetelet, Professor of Geodesy and Astronomy and Nerenburger, Professor of Descriptive Geometry. He collaborated with cartographic officers, and with the astronomer Houzeau, Quetelet's assistant. From the 1830's, he personally carried out triangulations, working out the calculations which were involved in them. Traces of his notes are to be found in the <i>Leçons de trigonométrie rectiligne</i> and the <i>Leçons de trigonométrie sphérique</i> published in 1844, as well as his <i>Cours de géodésie</i> dated 1845, which faithfully followed the French mathematical tradition. It is well known that since the 17th Century, particularly with the measurement of the metre during the French Revolution, France had played a leading role in the area of geodesy. But, from around 1820-1830, leadership passed fairly rapidly to Germany with the works of Gauss, Bessel and Baeyer who made systematic and relevant use of the method of least squares. Belgian scholars like Quetelet, Liagre, Nerenburger and Meyer, trained by the French, but open to other traditions, fostered the spread of German methods in Europe. A direct consequence of Meyer's travel to Germany in 1846 was the modification of his lectures on geodesy, and then of lecture material by other geodesists formerly written in the French tradition. Among these modifications are a section concerning the theory of errors, some lines on the personal equation, the use of the theory of least squares to obtain most probable values, an iteration method for the observation of angles, the use of the method of least squares as it arises in the calculation of most probable directions, and in the compensation theory for a network of triangles. The notation used for the solution by the method of indeterminate coefficients was that introduced by Gauss, and the weight equations correspond to those of Baeyer, as does also the study of their influence on the initial direction.</p>
<p>On February 6, 1847, Meyer presented a report on the application of the calculus of probabilities in operations of topographic surveying, to the science Section (“Classe") of the Royal Academy of Belgium. In this, he discussed an example of the use of the method of least squares. It was rejected by the Academy and never published. The bibliography of a thesis by L. Bouvier entitled <i>Dissertation sur la théorie des moindres carrés</i> which appeared in 1848 is identical with that of Meyer's report. Thus Meyer attempted to spread the information he had gathered in Germany on the method of least squares and its application to geodesy by channels other than those of Academic recognition. Bouvier remarked that there existed no special text describing the method of least squares, and that he hoped to fill this gap by giving an exposition from a practical viewpoint. Liagre's later work in 1852 would accomplish this on a larger scale. Bouvier does not discuss the foundations of the method. He concentrates essentially on the “method of equations" which are to be satisified. The author describes Gauss' two methods: he gives as an example the content of Meyer's note rejected by the Academy, and compares the formulae used by Gauss and Laplace to estimate the precision of arithmetic means. Both the importance of Meyer's contribution to geodesy and the obstacles which he encountered, as well as the militant devices he had to use to put his views, are evident.</p>
<p>Meyer's scientific opus consists of 30 papers and 12 textbooks. His publications on the calculus of probabilities were written in the latter part of his life, some of them appearing posthumously. In particular, we note his <i>Essai sur une exposition nouvelle de la théorie des probabilités a posteriori</i>, 1857. This work was at the printer's when Meyer died. The author goes over the enunciations and proofs of Bayes' theorem in the continuous case, Laplace's theorem and the inverse theorem to J. Bernoulli's; but one cannot honestly claim that he brings much that is new to probabilistic thinking.</p>
<p>Also in 1857, Meyer published his reaction “Examen critique de la notice de M. Liagre" to a memoir entitled “Sur la probabilité de l'existence d'une cause d'erreur régulière", which Liagre had presented to the Royal Academy of Belgium in 1855. The topic is the use of the calculus of probabilities to detect systematic errors, and is the precursor of a statistical <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">test</a> for the random nature of observations (the turning-point test). Liagre's article, which discusses the combinatorial aspects of the topic, is certainly subject to criticism, but so also is Meyer's reponse. This note, as well as another in 1856, was published at the author's expense; and provides further evidence of Meyer's disagreements with the science Section of the Royal Academy of Belgium, to which he had been elected a corresponding member on 16 December 1846. An account of this conflict, in which Meyer invoked the support of the leading authority of the day on statistical matters, I.J.Bienaymé (q.v.), is given by Breny, Jongmans and Seneta (1992). Bienaymé, himself no stranger to controversies, recalled it in a paper of 1875, which linked his name with the turning-points test.</p>
<p>Meyer was not a creator of originality in probability and statistics; but rather an interpreter, able to clarify, simplify and make rigorous in an age not noted for mathematical lucidity. He is better known in Luxemburg as the first poet of the Luxemburg language, and a man who fostered the development of national culture.<br />

<p><b>Octav ONICESCU</b><br />
b. 20 August 1892 - d. 19 August 1983<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Onicescu is principally known as co-founder,together with Gheorghe Mihoc (1906-1981), of the Romanian school of probability as well as for his contributions to mechanics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Octav Onicescu was born in 1892 in Botoşani, a town of North Moldavia, into the family of a small landowner. After his baccalaureat in 1911 he became a student of the University of Bucharest. He took a degree in mathematics in 1913, becoming then a teacher of mathematics at the reputed military gymnasium of Dealu Monastery, near Tâgovişte. After having been called for military duty in the period 1916-1918, he left for Rome in 1919, where in the feverish atmosphere generated by the Einstein theory of general relativity, he started a scientific activity which was to last for more than six decades. Guided by Tullio Levi-Civita (1873-1941) at the University of Rome, Onicescu has already defended his doctoral thesis <i>Sopra gli spazi einsteinieni a gruppi di transformazioni</i> by June 1920. In the autumn of 1920 Onicescu left for Paris, where he attended the lectures given at the Sorbonne by Émile Picard and Élie Cartan, and delivered papers on absolute differential calculus at the seminar led by Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963) at the Collège de France.</p>
<p>Onicescu's interest in probability theory and mechanics originated in his Italo-French period of studies. He got interested in probability by attending a seminar led by Francesco Paolo Cantelli (1875-1966) and his interest in mechanics stemmed from Cartan's lectures on integral invariants.</p>
<p>Back in Bucharest, Onicescu began (1922) a forty-year long university career of a great variety. In 1924 he started teaching the first university course on probability theory in Romania, an enterprise which went on without interruption until his retirement in 1962. In 1938 Onicescu was tenured as full professor at the chair of algebra of the Mathematics Section of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Bucharest, where he played a dominant part in modernizing the teaching of the subject. After the reorganization (1948) of higher education in Romania, Onicescu was until his retirement the head of the chair of probability theory of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the University of Bucharest. He organized and guided (even after retiring) the scientific seminars of the chair, which together with the expected chapters from probability and stochastic processes were dedicated to the most varied topics such as functional analysis, Lie groups and algebras, game theory, and mathematical logic. In the same period Onicescu was also the head of the Probability Theory Section of the newly (1949) founded Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy.</p>
<p>On the organizational side, Onicescu founded in 1931, under the auspices of the University of Bucharest, the School of Statistics, which was to become, ten years later, the Institute of Statistics, Actuarial Science and Computation of the University of Bucharest. The creation of this school was an answer to the lack of specialists in statistics, pointed out by the 1930 general population census in Romania. The students of the institute were university graduates and the duration of instruction was one year. The institute, dismantled in 1947, should be considered as one of the first institutions of postgraduate studies in statistics and computation in the world.</p>
<p>At the international level, Onicescu was one of the initiators of the Balkan Union of Mathematicians (founded 1934), which assembles the representatives of mathematicians from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, former Yugoslavia, Romania and Turkey. The setting up in 1968 of the International Centre for Mechanical Sciences in Udine (Italy) owes much to the scientific prestige of Onicescu, who acted as one of its nine initial sponsors.</p>
<p>In fact, Onicescu was not only an academic and a scientist. He was a great personality of Romanian culture and, especially in the inter-war period, he played an important part in the cultural, scientific and social activities of his country. In that period Onicescu co-edited such periodicals as <i>Natura (Nature)</i> and <i>Ideea european<span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \breve{a}$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/79/l2h/img1.png" title="$ \breve{a}$" width="15" /></span> (European Idea)</i>, where he contributed scores of papers on most various scientific, cultural and philosophical matters. He wrote frequently in newspapers on social, economic, demographic, and political issues - he even belonged for a while on an independent basis to the Chamber of Deputies of Romania - and took an active part in the organization or reorganization of several social, financial, teaching, and scientific institutions. The last group includes the Romanian Society of Sciences, where Onicescu was secretary general for many years and then president. He also presided over the Central Commission for the 1941 general population census in Romania. In 1938, as recognition of his many achievements, Onicescu was elected corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. He lost this rank in 1948, when the institution was reorganized, and it was only in 1965 that the injustice was repaired and Onicescu was made a full member of the Romanian Academy.</p>
<p>In more recent times, Onicescu's involvement in cultural and social matters manifested itself by his intensive participation in the activities of the Romanian Committee for the History and Philosophy of Sciences and above all by the organization and leadership of a Seminar on the applications of statistical and mathematical methods to economics at the Central Board of Statistics in Bucharest. Opened in January 1965, this seminar met regularly every week except for holidays. After some 450 sessions, it only ended with the physical disappearance of its initiator in 1983. Actually, in his last 20 years Onicescu took a keen interest in economics. In this context he was led to reconsider Gini's 1912 homogeneity coefficient <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 1-S$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/79/l2h/img2.png" title="$ 1-S$" width="50" /></span> under the name of <i>information energy</i> and to strongly advocate its use in various fields and as a basis for the constructing of the so-called <i>information statistics</i>; see [4], [5], [8].</p>
<p>Onicescu received international recognition for his mathematical researches. Elected as an ordinary member of the International Statistical Institute in 1935, he became an honorary member in 1982. Onicescu was also a member of the Academy of Sciences of Turin (since 1976).</p>
<p>Onicescu's mathematical career eludes normal appreciation and assessment. Fortunately, he provided a marvellous characterization of this scientific endeavour in a speech delivered at the Romanian Academy on the occasion of the celebration of his 75th birthday as follows:</p>
<blockquote>“I am not first of all a mathematician, by no means a probabilist as most agree, not even a mechancian as some do not want to consider me. I regard myself as a researcher of human actions, either social or enonomic, and natural phenomena, who used mathematical tools, preferably probabilistic or mechanical, who all his life strove to assimilate as much mathematics as he could for using it in his researches. I cultivated probability as a science of measurement of random events and processes. I cultivated mechanics as a support or a model of any science of natural motion. In this long and difficult way I met geometry, algebra, and analysis, sometimes topology, and I did not hesitate to take up the problems raised. It was my chance that at any important moments of my scientific or social enterprises I enjoyed ideas, and enthusiasm to materialize my projects that become common to all of us". [Tanslation from the Romanian of <i>An. Acad. R.S. România</i> (4) <b>18</b>(1986), p.295.]</blockquote>
<p>Fully in accordance with these words, the emphasis in Onicescu's mathematical work is on concepts, motivation and applicability rather than on technicalities.</p>
<p>There are two distinct phases in Onicescu's work in probability. In a first phase (up to 1958) he collaborated intensively with his first doctoral student Gheorghe Mihoc (1906-1981). Onicescu and Mihoc introduced and studied the concept of a chain with complete connections (see [2]), did an exhaustive study of the asymptotic behaviour of partial sums associated with finite Markov chains by using the method of characteristic functions and wrote several books on probability and mathematical statistics. This joint work laid down the basis of the Romanian school of probability theory. Mention should also be made here of Onecescu and Mihoc's co-founding in 1955 of the Braşov Conferences on Probability Theory, which clearly put this school into the limelight. This phases of Onicescu's work in probability is very well described in Mihoc's essay [3]; also in Onicescu's obituary notice on Mihoc [7].</p>
<p>In the second phase (after 1958), Onicescu's main achievement in probability was the elaboration of a new framework of probability theory, which replaces the classical event space, viewed as a point set equipped with a <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \sigma$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/79/l2h/img3.png" title="$ \sigma$" width="16" /></span> -field of subsets (Kolmogorov's axiomatization), by an abstract Boolean <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \sigma$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/79/l2h/img4.png" title="$ \sigma$" width="16" /></span> -algebra, thereby avoiding the consideration of the 'elementary event'. The new system based on the concepts of a sum function, which is an analogue of the indefinite integral, and a separator, which is an analogue of the family of sets <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \{\omega: f(\omega) &lt; \alpha\}_{\alpha}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/79/l2h/img5.png" title="$ \{\omega: f(\omega) &lt; \alpha\}_{\alpha}$" width="137" /></span> where <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \alpha$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/79/l2h/img6.png" title="$ \alpha$" width="17" /></span> runs over the reals and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ f$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/79/l2h/img7.png" title="$ f$" width="16" /></span> is a random variable (in the Kolmogorov system). The monograph [4] aimed at clarifying the part the new theory could play in the foundations of probability theory.</p>
<p>A fairly complete list of publications of Onicescu containing 222 papers and 32 books can be found in [1].</p>
<p>Onicescu died in Bucharest on 19th August 1983, the eve of his 91st birthday, after a short illness. He was a man with a great deal of charm and wit, who enjoyed an exceptional family life. This is apparent from the two volumes of memoirs [6] he was able to complete.<br />

<p><b>Johann Gregor MENDEL</b><br />
b. 22 July 1822 - d. 6 January 1884<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Mendel was definitively recognized as the originator of genetics only in the 1930s. He was one of the first to apply statistical methods in biology.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Mendel was born in 1822 in Heinzendorf, Austria (now Hyncice, Czech Republic) into a peasant family of German-Czech origin. In 1834, having been an able pupil of a village school, he was moved to a local gymnasium. From 1838 he had to support himself by tutoring and he graduated in 1840. In 1843, after mental crises caused by strained circumstances and an uncertain future, he completed a two-year course at the Olmuetz (Olomouc) Philosophical Institute whose curriculum included mathematics (with some combinatorial analysis) and physics. Mendel was now entitled to study at a university; instead he entered the monastery in Brünn (Brno) (1843), thus freeing himself of financial worries and finding conditions for further study. He took the name Gregor, adding it to his Christian name, Johann.</p>
<p>In 1848 Mendel became curate but his sensitivity hindered his duties and in 1849 the Abbot appointed him substitute gymnasium teacher of mathematics, Latin and Greek. In 1850, nervous and lacking university education, he failed one of the examinations of teaching competence, and the monastery was advised to send him to Vienna. Mendel indeed studied mathematics and the natural sciences there (1851-1853). In 1854 he was appointed teacher of physics, zoology and botany at the Realschule in Brno and continued to carry out some ecclesiastic duties. In 1856 he failed his second teaching examination, this time only because of his bad health, but remained a highly respected (substitute) teacher. In 1868 Mendel was elected Abbot and gave up teaching. Ultimately he died of a kidney disease and cardiac hypertrophy in 1884.</p>
<p>Mendel held liberal views and in 1848 he co-signed a petition for granting civil rights to members of religious orders. From 1875 he objected to the unjust (in his opinion) taxation of his monastery.</p>
<p>During his lfe, Mendel participated in local agricultural affairs. His free advice on growing plants and fruit trees and on beekeeping (an occupation where he achieved practical progress, if not the desired confirmation of his theory in the animal kingdom) was greatly appreciated and his varieties of plants were grown locally for many decades. He was an active member of several provincial and national agricultural societies and a founding member of the Austrian Meteorological Society. In 1857 he began recording meteorological data. He promoted weather forecasting for farmers and he correctly explained the origin of tornadoes in 1871, although it went unnoticed at the time.</p>
<p>Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel studied the hybridization of peas, first testing 34 of their varieties for the constancy of traits, and selecting 22 of them. He always examined a large number of plants to eliminate “chance effects" and thoroughly planned his experiments.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ A$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img1.png" title="$ A$" width="19" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img2.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> are the dominant and recessive alleles (possible genes) at a single locus of a plant, the phenotype (appearance) of whose seeds (say a round or angular pea) depends on the genetic composition at this locus. The possible genetic compositions (genotypes) are thus <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ AA$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img3.png" title="$ AA$" width="33" /></span> , <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Aa$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img4.png" title="$ Aa$" width="29" /></span> , and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ aa$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img5.png" title="$ aa$" width="24" /></span> , but <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Aa$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img6.png" title="$ Aa$" width="29" /></span> seeds have the same appearance as <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ AA$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img7.png" title="$ AA$" width="33" /></span> , and only the double-recessive seeds <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ aa$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img8.png" title="$ aa$" width="24" /></span> have different phenotype. If we suppose that alleles <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ A$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img9.png" title="$ A$" width="19" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img10.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> are equally represented in the genetic pool, random union of these to form the next generation of genotypes can be represented by <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (A + a)^2 = AA + 2Aa + aa$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img11.png" title="$ (A + a)^2 = AA + 2Aa + aa$" width="226" /></span> , so that the genotypes <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ AA, Aa, aa$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img12.png" title="$ AA, Aa, aa$" width="93" /></span> are in the ratio 1 : 2 : 1, but the two distinguishable phenotypes are in the ratio 3 : 1. This reasoning is an application of Mendel's First Law (of independent assortment of alleles). Now suppose another locus with alleles <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ B, b$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img13.png" title="$ B, b$" width="36" /></span> determines another phenotypic feature (say yellow or green in peas), with <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img14.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> recessive. Then the structure of the genetic material before random union can be represented by <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (A + a)(B + b) = AB + aB + Ab + ab$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img15.png" title="$ (A + a)(B + b) = AB + aB + Ab + ab$" width="315" /></span> , so that the 4 kinds of gametes exist in equal proportions. This reasoning is an application of Mendel's Second Law (of independent assortment). Random union of gametes then gives genotypic structure according to <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (AB + aB + Ab + ab)^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img16.png" title="$ (AB + aB + Ab + ab)^2$" width="190" /></span> . The resulting genotypes <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ AABB, AaBB, AABb, AaBb, AAbb, Aabb, aaBB, aaBb, aabb$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/70/l2h/img17.png" title="$ AABB, AaBB, AABb, AaBb, AAbb, Aabb, aaBB, aaBb, aabb$" width="494" /></span> are thus in the ratios 1 : 2 : 2 : 4 : 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 : 1, but the distinct phenotypes (involving two physical characteristics) are in the ratios 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Mendel wrote out segregation ratios such as this even for seven pairs of different traits.</p>
<p>In the 1900's and, finally, in the 1930's, Mendel's work was recognized as marking the beginnings of genetics. And he was one of the first to apply the statistical method, to use algebraic notation and elements of combinatorial analysis in biology. Alexander Humboldt, at the beginning of the century, initiated another branch of biology - of botany - namely the geography of plants, intrinsically connected with statistics. Other predecessors of Mendel were Alphonse De Candolle (also in geography of plants) and even Maupertuis (see Glass, 1959).</p>
<p>Mendel could not have properly understood all the aspects of his findings, but he justified the existence of discrete hereditory factors (genes, as well as alleles and gametes, being later terms) and discovered the principles of their random segregation and recombination. He aimed at achieving practical results, but a simultaneous study of heredity could well have been at the back of his mind. Now we know that individuals of the same species usually have differing sets of genes, so that their offspring are (intraspecific) hybrids. Mendel's experiments with hybridization were therefore crucial for the latter purpose. After acquainting himself with Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i> not later than 1863, he stated in 1866 that research such as his own was important for “the history of evolution of organic forms". Indeed, Darwin himself felt that he did not adequately explain evolution, and Mendel stated that something was lacking in his system.</p>
<p>Darwin did not hear about Mendel and would hardly have been able to understand his contemporary. He never used mathematical language and even wrote “elongated" triangles rather than “isosceles" ones. Indeed, biologists did not grasp Mendel's work at least up to the turn of the century; no wonder that his posthumous manuscripts at the monastery were burned. Biometricians did not recognize Mendel either; even in 1930 <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.) considered it a largely unproven theory. They were interested in measuring correlation between parent and offspring with regard to some trait rather than studying the theory of heredity. However, according to a recent study (Magnello, 1998), Pearson in 1909 suggested a synthesis of biometry and Mendelism. Later, in 1926, Bernstein (q.v.) proved that under wide assumptions the Galton law of inheritance of quantitative traits was a corollary of the Mendelian laws (Kolmogorov, 1938).</p>
<p>The trustworthiness of Mendel's experiments had been questioned. Fisher (q.v.) (1936) concluded that Mendel had correctly described their layout, but that their data were biased. van der Waerden inferred that Mendel had followed a sequential procedure, so that Fisher's opinion was only partly correct and that Mendel was honest. Later authors noted that some biological facts (e.g. the failure of some seeds to germinate) exonerated Mendel still more. And indirect evidence including his meteorological work indicates that Mendel meticulously recorded his observations.</p>
<p>By 1935, the Soviet Union became a leading center of Mendelian research. Then, however, genetics was called an idealistic science contrary to dialectical materialism and rooted out. Even Kolmogorov was criticized for his defense of its principles. The situation did not change until the 1960's.<br />

<p><b>Vilfredo Federigo Samaso PARETO</b><br />
b. 15 July 1848 - d. 19 August 1923<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b> Pareto showed empirically in 1896 that the distribution of income was asymptotically <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x^{-\alpha}$" border="0" height="18" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/80/l2h/img1.png" title="$ x^{-\alpha}$" width="35" /></span> , thus discovering the very first case of a stable non-Gaussian probability distribution.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Vilfredo Pareto was born in Paris, where his father, the Marquis Raffaele Pareto (1812-1882), an engineer from an old Genoese family, was in exile at the time for political reasons. His mother, Marie Métenier (1816-1889), was French, so that French was Pareto's mother tongue; it was only after the family's return to the Piedmont in 1852 that he mastered Italian. He had two sisters who left no progeny.</p>
<p>His first wife whom he married in 1889 was a Russian aristocrat, Alexandrina (Dina) Bakounine, who left him in 1900. He remarried to Jeanne Regis, a Frenchwoman with whom he had been living for twenty years, two months before his death. As he had no children, he left his fairly considerable fortune to her, having earlier donated his library to the University of Lausanne in 1908. He is buried at Céligny near Geneva in Switzerland, where he had been residing since 1900.</p>
<p>His life, public, intellectual and professional is fairly neatly divided into three phases.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> The period from his birth till 1870 was the formative phase. This was basically scientific and technical, although Pareto learned Greek and Latin by himself and became a discriminating connoisseur of these languages. He first attended the Leardi Technical Institute at Casale Monferrato (Piedmont) from 1859-1861, then the Royal Technical Institute of Turin (1861-1864). This was followed by the University of Turin (Torino), where he obtained his degree in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences in 1867, and finally by the School of Applied Engineering of this University. He was awarded his engineering diploma following a thesis on <i>La théorie de l'élasticité des corps solides et l'intégration des equations differentielles qui définissent l'équilibre.</i></p>
<p><b>2.</b> From 1870 to 1873, Pareto worked as an engineer on the Italian railways, then in 1873 joined a firm building railway material at San Giovanni Valdarno in Tuscany. He managed this firm from 1880 to 1890, becoming a consultant between 1890 and 1893. It was during this period, when he faced the economic and social problems of managing the firm that he became vitally interested in economics and sociology.</p>
<p>In 1874 he took part in the creation of the Société Adam Smith . During this period he wrote several papers for <i>L'economista</i> from 1876, the <i>Journal des Economistes</i> from 1887 and for the <i>Monde économique</i> and the <i>Giornale degli Economisti</i>. He also presented several communications at conferences.</p>
<p>He was resolutely in favour of a liberal economy, but he was also a pacifist and an anti-colonialist. He stood for election to the Chamber of Deputies but was not successful.</p>
<p>He travelled extensively abroad, residing on occasion in France, Germany, Austria, England, Belgium and Switzerland. In 1891 in Switzerland he met Léon Walras, whom he was to succeed in 1893 in the Chair of Political Economy at the University of Lausanne.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> From 1893 on, he devoted himself to teaching and research. As an economist he was a follower of A. Cournot (q.v.) and L. Walras in mathematical economics. His main innovation was a definition of equilibrium (Pareto's optimum) which is still in use today. But Pareto valued theory only insofar as it stood the <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">test</a> of reality; it was one of the reasons for his interest in statistics and for his work in this field.</p>
<p>As a sociologist, he was convinced that economic facts were inseparable from the society which engendered them. Thus, from 1897 until his retirement in 1911, he taught sociology as well.</p>
<p>It was during this period that his three main books were published:</p>
<p><i>Cours d'économie politique</i>, Lausanne, Vol.1 (1896) and Vol.2 (1897).</p>
<p><i>Manuale di economia politica con una introduzione alla scienza sociale</i>, Milano, 1906 (French translation: <i>Manuel d'Economie politique</i>, Paris, 1909).</p>
<p><i>Trattato di Sociologia</i>, Firenze, 1916 (French edition: <i>Traité de Sociologie</i>, Lausanne, 1917).</p>
<p>In <i>statistics</i> Pareto worked in three areas:</p>
<p><b>(a)</b> Interpolation and fitting methods to which he devoted several papers, in particular those in the <i>Journal de la Société Statistique de Paris</i>, November 1897, and in the <i>Zeitschrift für schweizerische Statistik</i>, XXXV, 1899, as well as the <i>Actes du IVème Congrès International de Psychologie</i> (Geneva, 1909).</p>
<p><b>(b)</b> Actuarial studies on mutual insurance systems and the calculation of pensions. He worked on these in 1905 in response to a request from the employees of the Swiss Federal Railways.</p>
<p>The main works which he published in the two areas (a) and (b) have been republished in Pareto (1989), where his paper “Sur les fonctions génératrices d'Abel" in pure mathematics, published in Kronecker's <i>Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik</i>, <b>110</b> (1892), 290-323, is also to be found.</p>
<p><b>(c)</b> But it was mainly his discovery in 1895 of the “Distribution curve for wealth and incomes" that Pareto is renowned as a statistician. He showed empirically that the observed distribution of incomes, like that of wealth was well fitted by theoretical distributions of the type</p>

<p>Later, this kind of distribution was found to arise in various fields, not only in the social sciences, but also in the natural and physical sciences. Various probabilistic models lead to such distributions: Pareto himself had attempted to develop probabilistic models as early as 1896 (see Pareto, 1964, supplements to Vol.2, pp.416-419). Thirty years later Maurice Fréchet (q.v.) was to perfect Pareto's model.</p>
<p>The most profound reason for the frequency with which Pareto distributions appear was given in 1935 by Paul Lévy (1937), namely that stable distributions, other than the Laplace-Gauss ( Normal) distribution, exhibit the asymptotic behaviour of type (1), with <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/80/l2h/img6.png" title="$ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2$" width="86" /></span> .</p>
<p>Further, when conditions for convergence to the Normal distribution in the Central Limit Theorem do not apply, namely when dealing with independent identically-distributed random summands whose large values have a non-negligible probability (heavy tailed distributions), if these distributions have tail behaviour asymptotically of type (1), then a Central Limit Theorem result still holds, with stable law of exponent <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \alpha$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/80/l2h/img7.png" title="$ \alpha$" width="17" /></span> figuring as the limit law, rather than the Normal.</p>
<p>It is thus to Pareto that belongs the immense credit for breaking the almost total monopoly of the Gaussian (Normal) distribution and its domain of attraction in statistics. Unfortunately it only earned him the lack of understanding and hostility of his peers, in particular F.Y. Edgeworth (q.v.).<br />

<p><b>Anderson Gray McKENDRICK</b><br />
b. 8 September 1876 - d. 30 May 1943<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Anderson McKendrick, a British medical doctor and capable mathematician, pioneered many discoveries in stochastic processes. He also collaborated with W.O. Kermack in path-breaking work on the deterministic model for the general epidemic.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The use of mathematical methods in epidemiology had become well established by the early 20th century. Among the pioneers were British scientists, such as Brownlee, Greenwood, Hamer, Ross and Soper. But none appears to have been as influential in this field of research as Anderson Gray McKendrick.</p>
<p>McKendrick was born in Edinburgh in 1876, the fifth and last child of John Gray McKendrick FRS and Mary Souttar. A few months after his birth, his father was appointed to the Chair of the Institutes of Medicine at the University of Glasgow, later renamed the Chair of Physiology in 1893. After graduating in medicine from the University of Glasgow in 1900, McKendrick joined the Indian Medical Service (IMS), achieving the top marks in their entrance examination. Before taking up his medical post in India, he was sent on special duty with Sir Ronald Ross in Sierra Leone to study anti-malarial operations, and the two returned to Britain on the same ship. Ross was keen on the mathematical modelling of malarial transmission, and exerted an important (and generously acknowledged) influence on McKendrick's later work in mathematical epidemiology. For a more detailed account of these and other events in McKendrick's life, the reader is referred to Aitchison and Watson (1988).</p>
<p>It was customary for new recruits to the IMS to undertake a period of military service, and Lieutenant McKendrick spent 18 months in Somaliland during the expedition against the Mahdi of the Sudan. Among his activities, he succeeded in building a tank to contain safe water for his troops. On his return to India, he was posted to Nadia in the Bengal, where he further demonstrated his interest in public health by attempting to reduce the occurrence of dysentery in the district jail.</p>
<p>In 1905, McKendrick was appointed to the Research Department of the Government of India, and posted to the Pasteur Institute at Kausali in the Punjab. He became interested in rabies and, in 1907, wrote a memoir on anti-rabic immunisation with W.F. Harvey. His routine at Kausali included a systematic study of Mellor's <i>Higher Mathematics for Students of Chemistry and Physics</i>.</p>
<p>McKendrick served in India for several years, rising to be a Lieutenant-Colonel in the IMS; he worked in the Pasteur Institute at Coonoor in Southern India, briefly became Statistical Officer with the Government of India at Simla, and returned to Kausali as Director of its Pasteur Institute. His time there coincided with the First World War, and the pursuit of research, which was his principal interest, proved difficult; he worked on problems of epidemiology, including the mode of carriage of infections. Having contracted sprue, a tropical disease characterized by diarrhea, emaciation and anemia, he was retired from the IMS to Britain in 1920 to recover, and settled in Edinburgh with his wife and four children.</p>
<p>Shortly after, he was appointed to the post of Superintendent of the Laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, an institution partly supported by the Carnegie Trust. The young W.O. Kermack, later to become Professor at Aberdeen and an FRS, was appointed at the same time to a post in biochemistry in the Laboratory. Though blinded in an experiment in 1924, this did not prevent him from continuing his work.</p>
<p>Anderson McKendrick held his position at the Royal College of Physicians for over 20 years. He organized the Laboratory for large scale routine medical examinations, while also creating a new department of medical chemistry, and a specialised department of medical research. He held the view that the Laboratory should be research oriented, with the senior staff freed from teaching and administration. He pursued his own interests there, collaborating with W.O. Kermack in many of his epidemiological papers, in particular on the deterministic model for the general epidemic.</p>
<p>McKendrick's 58 publications discuss a variety of topics: medical (on rabies and malaria), statistical (on classification and age distribution), demographic (on death rates in Britain and Sweden), and increasingly after his appointment at Edinburgh, on anti-rabies treatment and different aspects of mathematical epidemiology. He recognized that his mathematical papers would not be easily understood by medical colleagues, and attempted in general lectures to popularize his subject for their benefit. He was a sensitive and kindly leader of men, who was congratulated by Professor J.T. Wilson of Cambridge (see W.F.H., 1943) for the Carnegie Trust on the “spirit of comradeship pervading the entire laboratory staff", as well as the laboratory's “achievements in a number of important fields of research". McKendrick retired in 1941 and died in 1943 at Carrbridge in Inverness-Shire.</p>
<p>In the development of mathematical epidemiology, Hamer in 1906 had been the first to suggest a concept of mass action (homogeneous mixing) for London measles epidemics. Ross in 1911 independently made use of this principle in the appendix of his book on malaria, and McKendrick developed it further, both individually (1912), and in his joint work with Kermack (1927). McKendrick, inspired as he was by Ross's work on epidemics, is remarkable for three major contributions to epidemic modelling. The first is contained in a paper published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society (1914) in which he effectively described the Poisson Process, derived equations for the pure birth process, and a particular birth-death process. He also formulated the differential equations for the deterministic general epidemic, which he later elaborated with Kermack (1927). Already in this early work, he had anticipated many of the later discoveries in the area of stochastic processes.</p>
<p>The second is contained in a paper in the Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society (1926). In this he considered two types of one-dimensional compartmental models, and examined a semi-stochastic case; he was able to conclude from this that a Poisson distribution in observed cases of illness meant that there was no infectious process involved. In his Example 2 on a cholera epidemic in India, data was collected on the numbers of households in which <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 0, 1, 2, 3$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img1.png" title="$ 0, 1, 2, 3$" width="67" /></span> , and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ 4$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img2.png" title="$ 4$" width="14" /></span> cases of infection had been observed. The Poisson distribution was a good fit except for the case, where the expected Poisson value was very much smaller than the observed value. This suggested to McKendrick that the primary cause of infection was probably a particular well from which the majority of infected households drank; on further investigation, this proved to be the case. He also went on to study the two-dimensional compartmental case. One may regard some of his results for the numbers <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ v$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img3.png" title="$ v$" width="14" /></span> of individuals in compartment <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (x,y)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img4.png" title="$ (x,y)$" width="48" /></span> as foreshadowing the differential <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ xy$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img5.png" title="$ xy$" width="25" /></span> equations for the probabilities of the general stochastic epidemic. For discussions of the results in these papers, the reader is referred to Irwin (1963), Gani (1982) and most recently Dietz's (1997) introduction to the 1926 paper.</p>
<p>His third contribution with Kermack (1927) is perhaps the best known of all: in it, they set out the equations for the deterministic general epidemic in a closed population of size <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ N$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img6.png" title="$ N$" width="22" /></span> . This is subdivided into <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x(t)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img7.png" title="$ x(t)$" width="37" /></span> suceptibles, <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ y(t)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img8.png" title="$ y(t)$" width="36" /></span> infectives and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ z(t)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img9.png" title="$ z(t)$" width="35" /></span> immunes, where <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x(t)+y(t)+z(t) = N$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img10.png" title="$ x(t)+y(t)+z(t) = N$" width="187" /></span> . Infection spreads through homogeneous mixing, so that</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle dx/dt = -bxy, dy/dt = bxy - gy, dz/dt = gy,$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img11.png" title="$\displaystyle dx/dt = -bxy, dy/dt = bxy - gy, dz/dt = gy,$" width="372" /></div>
where <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img12.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> is the rate of infection, and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ g$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img13.png" title="$ g$" width="14" /></span> the rate of removal of infectives from the population. These equations may be found in the earlier work of Ross in 1915 and Ross and Hudson in 1917 as can also the consequent threshold result, so that strict priority would attribute the results to these authors. Kermack and McKendrick (1927) themselves acknowledge this earlier work but claim to go a stage further. Epidemiologists have commonly regarded the solution of the differential equations and the formalisation of the threshold theorem as Kermack and McKendrick's.
<p>An explicit solution to the equations was obtained by them using a quadratic approximation to the exponential; this then leads to the so-called Kermack-McKendrick threshold theorem. Briefly, its results state that the epidemic will spread only if <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x(0) &gt; g/b$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img14.png" title="$ x(0) &gt; g/b$" width="91" /></span> , and that under certain simple conditions, there will always be some susceptibles left at the end of the epidemic. Very roughly, if <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x(\infty)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img15.png" title="$ x(\infty)$" width="49" /></span> susceptibles survive, then</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle x(\infty) = x(0) - 2g/b,$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/69/l2h/img16.png" title="$\displaystyle x(\infty) = x(0) - 2g/b,$" width="173" /></div>
where this must be positive.
<p>McKendrick's work of 1926 and Kermack and McKendrick's deterministic results of 1927 were extended in full detail to the stochastic general epidemic by Bartlett (1949), and a threshold theorem for the stochastic case derived by Whittle (1955). A large part of the subsequent development of epidemic modelling stems from their seminal paper, which together with Ross's pioneering work can be regarded as the foundations of modern mathematical epidemiology.</p>

<p><b>Blaise PASCAL</b><br />
b. 19 June 1623 - d. 19 August 1662<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b> Pascal introduced the concept of mathematical expectation and used it recursively to obtain a solution to the Problem of Points which was the catalyst that enabled probability theory to develop beyond mere combinatorial enumeration.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Blaise Pascal was born in Clermont, France. In 1631 his father Etienne Pascal (himself an able mathematician who gave his name to the '<i>limaçon</i> of Pascal') moved his family to Paris in order to secure his son a better education, and in 1635 was one of the founders of Marin Mersenne's 'Academy', the finest exchange of mathematical information in Europe at the time. To this informal academy he introduced his son at the age of fourteen, and Blaise immediately put his new source of knowledge to good use, producing (at the age of sixteen) his <i>Essay pour les coniques</i>, a single printed sheet enunciating Pascal's Theorem, that the opposite sides of a hexagon inscribed in a conic intersect in three collinear points.</p>
<p>At the age of eighteen the younger Pascal turned his attention to constructing a calculating machine (to help his father in his calculations) and within a few years he had built and sold fifty of them. Some still exist. In 1646 he started work on hydrostatics, determining the weight of air experimentally and writing on the vacuum (leading ultimately to the choice of 'Pascal' as the name for the S.I. unit of pressure).</p>
<p>In 1654 Pascal returned to mathematics, extending his early work on conics in a manuscript which was never printed and which does not now exist, though it was seen by Leibniz. In the same year he entered into correspondence with <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=33" name="menu0">Pierre de Fermat</a> (q.v.) of Toulouse about some problems in calculating the odds in games of chance which led him to write the <i>Traité du triangle arithmétique, avec quelques autres petits traitez sur la mesme matière</i>, probably in August of that year. Not published until 1665, this work, and the correspondence itself which was published in 1679, is the basis of Pascal's reputation in probability theory as the originator of the concept of expectation and its use recursively to solve the 'Problem of Points', as well as the justification for calling the arithmetical triangle 'Pascal's triangle'. His advances, considered to be the foundation of modern probability theory, are described in detail below.</p>
<p>Later in 1654 Pascal underwent a religious experience as a result of which he almost entirely abandoned his scientific work and devoted his remaining years to writing his <i>Lettres provinciales</i>, written in 1656 and 1657 in defence of Antoine Arnauld, and his <i>Pensées</i>, drafts for an <i>Apologie de la Religion Chrétienne</i>, which include his famous 'wager' (see below). In 1658-59 Pascal briefly returned to mathematics, writing on the curve known as the cycloid, but his final input into the development of probability theory arises through his presumed contribution to <i>La logique, ou l'art de penser</i> by Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, published in 1662. This classic philosophical treatise is often called the <i>Port-Royal Logic</i> through the association of its authors, and Pascal himself, with the Port-Royal Abbey, a centre of the Jansenist movement within the Catholic church, into whose convent Pascal's sister Jacqueline had been received in 1652.</p>
<p>Pascal died in Paris, in good standing with the Church and is buried in the church of St Etienne du Mont.</p>
<p>The <i>Traité du triangle arithmétique</i> itself is 36 pages long (setting aside <i>quelques autres petits traitez sur la mesme matière</i>) and consists of two parts. The first carries the title by which the whole is usually known, in English translation <i>A Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle</i>, and is an account of the arithmetical triangle as a piece of pure mathematics. The second part <i>Uses of the Arithmetical Triangle</i> consists of four sections: (1)<i>Use in the theory of figurate numbers</i>, (2)<i>Use in the theory of combinations</i>, (3)<i>Use in dividing the stakes in games of chance</i>, (4)<i>Use in finding the powers of binomial expressions</i>.</p>
<p>Pascal opens the first part by defining an unbounded rectangular array like a matrix in which 'The number in each cell is equal to that in the preceding cell in in the same row', and he considers the special case in which the cells of the first row and column each contain 1. Symbolically, he has defined <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \{f_{i,j}\}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img1.png" title="$ \{f_{i,j}\}$" width="48" /></span> where</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle f_{i,j} = f_{i-1,j} + f_{i,j-1}, i,j= 2,3,4,..., f_{i,1}= f_{1,j} = 1, i,j = 1,2,3,...$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img2.png" title="$\displaystyle f_{i,j} = f_{i-1,j} + f_{i,j-1}, i,j= 2,3,4,..., f_{i,1}= f_{1,j} = 1, i,j = 1,2,3,...$" width="533" /></div>
<p>The rest of Part I is devoted to a demonstration of nineteen corollaries flowing from this definition, and concludes with a 'problem'. The corollaries include all the common relations among the <i>binomial coefficients</i> (as the entries of the triangle are now universally called), none of which was new. Pascal proves the twelfth corollary, <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (j-1)f_{i,j} = if_{i+1,j-1}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img3.png" title="$ (j-1)f_{i,j} = if_{i+1,j-1}$" width="176" /></span> in our notation, by explicit use of mathematical induction. The `problem' is to find <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ f_{i,j}$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img4.png" title="$ f_{i,j}$" width="29" /></span> as a function of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ i$" border="0" height="16" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img5.png" title="$ i$" width="11" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ j$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img6.png" title="$ j$" width="14" /></span> , which Pascal does by applying the twelfth corollary recursively. Part I of the <i>Treatise</i> thus amounts to a systematic development of all the main results then known about the properties of the numbers in the arithmetical triangle.</p>
<p>In Part II Pascal turns to the applications of these numbers. The numbers thus defined have three different interpretations, each of great antiquity (to which he does not, however, refer). The successive rows of the triangle define the <i>figurate numbers</i> which have their roots in Pythagorean arithmetic. Pascal treats these in section (1),</p>
<p>The second interpretation is as <i>binomial numbers</i>, the coefficients of a binomial expansion, which are arrayed in the successive diagonals, their identity with the figurate numbers having been recognized in Persia and China in the eleventh century and in Europe in the sixteenth. The above definition of <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ f_{i,j}$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img7.png" title="$ f_{i,j}$" width="29" /></span> is obvious on considering the expansion of both sides of</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle (x+y)^n = (x+y) (x+y)^{n-1}.$" border="0" height="40" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img8.png" title="$\displaystyle (x+y)^n = (x+y) (x+y)^{n-1}.$" width="244" /></div>
The fact that the coefficient of <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x^{r} y^{n-r}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img9.png" title="$ x^{r} y^{n-r}$" width="58" /></span> in the expansion of <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (x+y)^n$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img10.png" title="$ (x+y)^n$" width="72" /></span> may be expressed as
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1)}{1.2.3...r} = {n \choose r}$" border="0" height="63" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img11.png" title="$\displaystyle \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1)}{1.2.3...r} = {n \choose r}$" width="307" /></div>
was known to the Arabs in the thirteenth century and to the Renaissance mathematician Cardano in 1570. It provides a closed form for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ f_{i,j}$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img12.png" title="$ f_{i,j}$" width="29" /></span> , with <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ n = i + j -2$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img13.png" title="$ n = i + j -2$" width="112" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ r = i -1$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img14.png" title="$ r = i -1$" width="78" /></span> . Pascal treats the binomial interpretation in section (4).
<p>The third interpretation is as a <i>combinatorial number</i>, for the number of combinations of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img15.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> different things taken <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img16.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> at a time, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont {} n}$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img17.png" title="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont {} n}$" width="14" /></span> C <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img18.png" title="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r}$" width="12" /></span> is equal to <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ { n \choose r}$" border="0" height="40" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img19.png" title="$ { n \choose r}$" width="30" /></span> , a result known in India in the ninth century, to Hebrew writers in the fourteenth century, and to Cardano in 1550. Pascal deals with that interpretation in section (2), giving a novel demonstration of the combinatorial version of the basic addition relation <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont n+}$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img20.png" title="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont n+}$" width="24" /></span> <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ ^{ 1}$" border="0" height="20" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img21.png" title="$ ^{ 1}$" width="12" /></span> itC <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r+1}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img22.png" title="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r+1}$" width="29" /></span> = <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont {} n}$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img23.png" title="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont {} n}$" width="14" /></span> C <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img24.png" title="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r}$" width="12" /></span> + <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont {} n}$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img25.png" title="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont {} n}$" width="14" /></span> itC <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r+}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img26.png" title="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r+}$" width="22" /></span> <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ _{ 1}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img27.png" title="$ _{ 1}$" width="12" /></span> , for, considering any particular one of the <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ n+1$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img28.png" title="$ n+1$" width="48" /></span> things, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont n}$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img29.png" title="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont n}$" width="14" /></span> C <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img30.png" title="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r}$" width="12" /></span> gives the number of combinations that include it and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont n}$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img31.png" title="$ ^{\fontshape{it}\selectfont n}$" width="14" /></span> itC <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r+}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img32.png" title="$ _{\fontshape{it}\selectfont r+}$" width="22" /></span> <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ _{ 1}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img33.png" title="$ _{ 1}$" width="12" /></span> the number that exclude it.</p>
<p>In section (3) Pascal breaks new ground, and this section, taken together with his correspondence with Fermat, is the basis of his reputation as the father of probability theory. The “problem of points” which he discusses, also known simply as the “division problem”, involves determining how the total stake should be divided in the event of a game of chance being terminated prematurely. Suppose two players <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ X$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img34.png" title="$ X$" width="22" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Y$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img35.png" title="$ Y$" width="20" /></span> stake equal money on being the first to win <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img36.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> points in a game in which the winner of each point is decided by the toss of a fair coin. If such a game is interrupted when <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ X$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img37.png" title="$ X$" width="22" /></span> still lacks <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img38.png" title="$ x$" width="15" /></span> points and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Y$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img39.png" title="$ Y$" width="20" /></span> lacks <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ y$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img40.png" title="$ y$" width="15" /></span> , how should the total stake be divided between them? In the middle of the sixteenth century Tartaglia famously concluded “the resolution of such a question is judicial rather than mathematical, so that in whatever way the division is made there will be cause for litigation”. A century later, in the summer of 1654, the correct solution was derived by three different arguments during the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat. One of the methods, advanced by Pascal in his letter of July 29, involves computing expectations recursively.</p>
<p>The key development was his understanding that the value of a gamble is equal to its mathematical expectation computed as the average of the values of each of two equally-probable outcomes, and that this precise definition of value lends itself to recursive computation because the value of a gamble that one is certain to win is undoubtedly the total stake itself. Thus if the probabilities of winning <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img41.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> or <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img42.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> units are each one half, the expectation is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (a + b)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img43.png" title="$ (a + b)$" width="60" /></span> units, which is then the value of the gamble. In <i>Ars conjectandi</i> (1713) James Bernoulli (q.v.) called this “the fundamental principle of the whole art”. Pascal has invented the concept of “expected value”, that is the probability of a win multiplied by its value, and understood that it is an exact mathematical concept which can be manipulated.</p>
<p>In the letter to Fermat, Pascal develops the recursive argument applied to expected values in order to find the correct division of the stake-money, and thus computes the “value” of each successive throw. In the <i>Traité</i> the same idea is more formally expressed, and in particular Pascal gives as a principle the value of the expectation when the chances are equal. He remarks at one point that “the division has to be proportional to the chances”, but in the solution to the problem when the players have equal chances the question of computing an expectation for unequal chances does not arise; that extension was first formally made by Huygens (q.v.) in his <i>De ratiociniis in ludo aleae</i> of 1657. It is known that when Huygens spent July-September 1655 in Paris he had the opportunity to discuss Pascal's work on probability problems with Roberval, and presumably learnt of the concept of mathematical expectation then.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand how Pascal used expectation and recursion to solve the problem of points is to visualise the event-tree of possible further results. Each bifurcation corresponds to a toss, one branch for <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ X$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img44.png" title="$ X$" width="22" /></span> winning it and the other for <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Y$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img45.png" title="$ Y$" width="20" /></span> , and successive bifurcations must lead eventually to tips corresponding to the whole game being won by either <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ X$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img46.png" title="$ X$" width="22" /></span> or <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Y$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img47.png" title="$ Y$" width="20" /></span> . Considering now the expectation of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ X$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img48.png" title="$ X$" width="22" /></span> (say), each tip can be labelled with his expectation, either <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ S$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img49.png" title="$ S$" width="17" /></span> (the total stake) or 0, as the case may be. Applying now Pascal's expectation rule for equal chances, each bifurcation can have an expectation associated with it, working recursively down the tree from the tips to the root, at which point we find the solution to the problem. If <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ E(x,y)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img50.png" title="$ E(x,y)$" width="63" /></span> be the expectation of player <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ X$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img51.png" title="$ X$" width="22" /></span> when he lacks <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img52.png" title="$ x$" width="15" /></span> points and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Y$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img53.png" title="$ Y$" width="20" /></span> lacks <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ y$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img54.png" title="$ y$" width="15" /></span> , then the recursion is</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle E(x,y) = E(x-1,y) + E(x,y-1).$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/81/l2h/img55.png" title="$\displaystyle E(x,y) = E(x-1,y) + E(x,y-1).$" width="298" /></div>
<p>By these methods, and his knowledge of the arithmetical triangle, Pascal was able to demonstrate how the stake should be divided between the players according to the partial sums of the binomial coefficients, a result which he had already obtained by enumeration, for both he and Fermat had realised that the actual game of uncertain length could be embedded in a game of fixed length to which the binomial distribution (as yet undiscovered) could then be applied. Further details of their reasoning may be found in the references below.</p>
<p>Three further contributions of Pascal to the development of probability theory may be noted. In <i>Pensées</i> he used his concept of expectation to argue that one should bet on the existence of God because, however small the probability of His existence, the value of eternal salvation if He does exist is infinite, so that the expected value of assuming that He does exist far exceeds that of assuming that He does not. Subsequent writers have regarded this, “Pascal's wager”, as the origin of decision theory. Secondly, in 1656 Pascal posed Fermat a problem which became known as the “gambler's ruin” and which played a central role in the development of probability theory as the first example of a problem about the duration of play. Finally, he greatly influenced the probability arguments in the itPort-Royal Logic, in the last chapter of which there is a clear understanding of the importance of judging an action not only by the possible gain or loss, but also by the probability of each of these. One must “consider mathematically the magnitudes when these things are multiplied together”. This is the first occasion in which the word “ probability" is used (in French, of course) in its modern sense.<br />

<p><b>Georg von MAYR</b><br />
b. 12 February 1841 - d. 6 September 1925<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. G. von Mayr was the foremost representative of German administrative and bureaucratic statistics. He was hostile to the use of the probability calculus and mathematics generally in the resolution of statistical questions.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Georg von Mayr was born at Würzburg in Franconia, Germany, where his father Aloys (1807-1890) was a Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy. However, Georg pursued his studies in law and political science in Munich.</p>
<p>In 1864, he was appointed to the Bavarian Statistical Bureau where he acted as assistant to his professor and future father-in-law Friedrich B.W. von Hermann (1795-1868), and worked on a thesis in criminal statistics which he defended in 1865. Von Mayr received his Habilitation from the Faculty of Statistics of the University of Munich in 1866, and was appointed Privatdozent before being named Professor Extraordinarius in 1868. After Hermann's death, von Mayr directed the Statistical Bureau from 1869 to 1879. This was the decade in which the constitution and structure of Bismarck's Imperial State (Reich) took shape. Statistics was an essential instrument in this structure, and von Mayr found himself at the forefront of its developments. He became known as the advocate of reforms both in the organization and the scientific activity of the Statistical Bureau, first in Bavaria and later in the Reich. He undertook the centralization of statistical services, and in 1869 founded a journal (<i>Zeitschrift des Königlich Bayerischen Statistischen Büros</i>) which enabled census material to be published, as well describing activities of the Bureau itself. A very active member of the Commission for the Preparation of Imperial Statistics (Reichskommission zur Vorbereitung der Reichsstatistik), he refused the attractive offer of the directorship of the Imperial Statistical Service (Kaiserliches Statistisches Amt), preferring to remain in Bavaria.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in 1872, as counsellor to the Ministry of the Interior and again in 1879 as Commissioner for the Bundesrat, he was consulted on some thorny questions of customs policy. Ennobled in 1879, he left Munich (München) for the duties of under-secretary of Finances in Strasbourg (Strasburg), where he vigorously defended the economic policy of Bismarck. Following the Reichstag elections of 1887, which resulted in his finding himself in a minority, he resigned his ministerial duties and once again devoted himself to academic scientific activity.</p>
<p>After a brief stay at the University of Strasburg, he returned to Munich in 1898 to the Chair of Political Economy, Financial Sciences and Statistics. In 1913-14 he acceded to the position of Rector.</p>
<p>In 1890, while still in Alsace, he had founded the journal <i>Allgemeines statistisches Archiv</i>, which he edited until 1907. The journal was then suspended for a time, and resumed publication only in 1914, when von Mayr handed over the editorship to Friedrich Zahn (1869-1944) while continuing to support the journal with his articles. In addition, he became the head of the German Statistical Society (Deutsche statistische Gesellschaft) created in Dresden in 1911, of which the <i>Allgemeines statistisches Archiv</i> became the organ. G. von Mayr thus took part in the foundation and the activities of the great statistical institutions: he was a member of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) from the time of its creation in 1885, becoming its Vice-president from 1911 to 1923. He was President of the German section, and also Vice-President of the Comité permanent international des Congrès des Assurances sociales.</p>
<p>In 1911, he added an actuarial component to the Seminar in Statistics which he had founded at the University of Munich. This new Seminar fulfilled the role of providing an actuarial diploma for candidates having either a mathematical or administrative background.</p>
<p>After becoming Emeritus in 1920, von Mayr remained very active within the University of Munich. He died at his home in Tutzing, near the Starnberger See.</p>
<p>G. von Mayr's career, which followed the archetype of the German professor- bureaucrat, testifies to the importance of the role he played in the history of administrative statistics, both nationally and internationally. As a result of his experience as Head of Bavarian statistics, von Mayr was able to extend and impose a rigorous reforming and centralizing methodology on the other statistical bureaux which had arisen in the different German provinces during the 19th century. All the ideas involved were debated in the early congresses of the ISI, where problems of the unification of statistical methodology and practice were raised.</p>
<p>Research on statistical methods was logically underpinned by von Mayr's conception of statistics as an autonomous discipline, with its own methods and objectives. He made an active contribution to disentangling descriptive statistics from the confused environment where political economy, geography, sociology and other disciplines were all mixed in together, and was one of the most enthusiastic promoters of extended descriptive statistics forming “an exact science of mass social phenomena". Thus at the ISI Congress of 1889 in Paris, von Mayr elaborated his point of view on the monographic method which had first appeared in 1829, and was later codified in 1856 by the French polytechnician F. Le Play. Von Mayr was above all critical of the status given to “type" in social phenomena. Under his guidance, long descriptive studies were carried out in economic, criminal, social, professional and demographic statistics; such studies, he maintained, essential for disengaging “typical" phenomenona from any "law of social life".</p>
<p>It is therefore not surprising that von Mayr remained a tireless opponent of Quetelet's (q.v.) views throughout his life. His aversion to “the average man" extended to a more general distrust of statistical methods based on a priori mathematical arguments. He thus argued against the use of “representative methods" (sample surveys) invented by the Norwegian N.A. Kiaer (q.v.) and discussed in the ISI Congresses towards the end of the century. In the same way, he always expressed the greatest reservations about the use of mathematical methods in statistics, as well as about Lexis' (q.v.) concept of basing mathematical statistics (which Lexis referred to as “analytical statistics" by analogy with mechanics) on the calculus of probabilities. Nevertheless, he counted among his students and assistants in the Seminar at the University of Munich, Friedrich Böhm and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=45" name="menu0">Emil Julius Gumbel</a> (q.v.), whose works in actuarial science and statistics were of a very mathematical nature.</p>
<p>One cannot deny that his scepticism about mathematical statistics had ill effects on the development of statistics in Germany up to the middle of the twentieth century. His heirs, proud holders of the German tradition of administrative statistics, which was gradually ossified by a conservatism tinged with imperial nostalgia (a widespread characteristic of the German administrative apparatus after 1918), contributed to cutting German science off from the striking development of mathematical statistics in English-speaking countries at the same time. This was the essence of Paul Flaskämper's judgment of 1944 on von Mayr, even though he was called the “Altmeister der deutschen Statistik" .</p>
<p>It should however be noted that von Mayr's renown lasted until World War 2 in those parts of Europe influenced by German culture. This was the case of Hungary and Italy, and more surprisingly the USSR. The Russian translation of his treatise of 1877, carried out in 1887 by Romanov under the direction of the great statistician A.V. Chuprov (the father of A.A.Chuprov, q.v.), recorded his fierce opposition to Quetelet. This work was read by Soviet scientists as that of a capitalist statistician par excellence, and made the Bismarckian von Mayr one of the main methodological references of statisticians in the Soviet administration. This is not the least of history's jokes!<br />

<p><b>Karl PEARSON</b><a href="#foot76" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a><br />
b. 27 March 1857 - d 27 April 1936<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Karl Pearson was Founder of the Biometric School. He made prolific contributions to statistics, eugenics and to the scientific method. Stimulated by the applications of W.F.R. Weldon and F. Galton he laid the foundations of much of modern mathematical statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Founder of biometrics, Karl Pearson was one of the principal architects of the modern theory of mathematical statistics. He was a polymath whose interests ranged from astronomy, mechanics, meteorology and physics to the biological sciences in particular (including anthropology, eugenics, evolutionary biology, heredity and medicine). In addition to these scientific pursuits, he undertook the study of German folklore and literature, the history of the Reformation and German humanists (especially Martin Luther). Pearson's writings were prodigious: he published more than 650 papers in his lifetime, of which 400 are statistical. Over a period of 28 years, he founded and edited 6 journals and was a co-founder (along with Weldon and Galton) of the journal <i>Biometrika</i>. University College London houses the main set of Pearson's collected papers which consist of 235 boxes containing family papers, scientific manuscripts and 16,000 letters.</p>
<p>Largely owing to his interests in evolutionary biology, Pearson created, almost single-handedly, the modern theory of statistics in his Biometric School at University College London from 1892 to 1903 (which was practised in the Drapers' Biometric Laboratory from 1903-1933). These developments were underpinned by Charles Darwin's ideas of biological variation and `statistical' populations of species - arising from the impetus of statistical and experimental work of his colleague and closest friend, the Darwinian zoologist, W.F.R. Weldon (q.v.). Additional developments emerged from <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=38" name="menu0">Francis Galton</a>'s (q.v.) law of ancestral heredity. Pearson also devised a separate methodology for problems of eugenics in the Galton Eugenics Laboratory from 1907-1933.</p>
<p>In his creation of biometrics, out of which the discipline of mathematical statistics had developed by the end of the nineteenth century, Pearson introduced a new vernacular for statistics (including such terms as the standard deviation, mode, homoscedasticity, heteroscedasticity, kurtosis and the product-moment correlation coefficient).<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Family and Education</b></p>
<p>Karl was the second of three children born to William Pearson and Fanny Smith. His father was a barrister and QC. The Pearsons were of Yorkshire descent. They were a family of dissenters and of Quaker stock. By the time he was in his 20s, Pearson had rejected Christianity and had become a Freethinker which involved the 'rejection of all myths as explanation and the frank acceptance of all ascertained truths to the relation of the finite to the infinite'. Politically, he was a socialist whose outlook was similar to the Fabians, but he never joined the Fabian Society. Socialism was a form of morality for Pearson; the moral was social and the immoral was anti-social in conduct.</p>
<p>Pearson's father William was a very hard-working and taciturn man. In a letter to Karl, his elder brother Arthur described the experience of being home with their father as 'simply purgatory...the governor never spoke a word'.</p>
<p>When they went up to Cambridge, at least one of the Pearson boys was expected to read mathematics. The Cambridge Mathematics Tripos was, at that time, the most prestigious degree in any British university. Although his father urged him to read mathematics, Arthur settled on Classics. Thus when Karl was 15 years old, his father was looking for a good Cambridge Wrangler to prepare him for the Mathematics Tripos.</p>
<p>By the Spring of 1875, Pearson was ready to take the entrance examinations at various colleges at Cambridge. His first choice was Trinity College, where he failed the entrance exam; his second choice was King's College from whom he received an Open Fellowship in April 1875. Pearson found that the highly competitive and demanding system leading up to the Mathematical Tripos was the tonic he needed. Though he had been a rather delicate and sickly child with a nervous disposition, he came to life in this environment and his health improved. Students of the Mathematics Tripos were also expected to take regular exercise as a means of preserving a robust constitution and regulating the working day.</p>
<p>Pearson took the Mathematics Tripos examination in January 1879. He graduated with honours being the Third Wrangler; subsequently, he received a fellowship from King's College which he held for seven years.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks after Pearson had taken his degree, he began to work in Professor James Stuart's Engineering workshop and read philosophy during the Lent Term in preparation for a trip to Germany.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Germany and University College London</b></p>
<p>Pearson's time in Germany was a period of self-discovery, philosophically and professionally. While in Heidelberg Pearson read Berkeley, Fichte, Locke, Kant and Spinoza, but he subsequently abandoned philosophy. He studied physics under Quincke and metaphysics under Kuno Fischer. He considered becoming a mathematical physicist, but decided not to pursue this. He went to Berlin to hear Kirchoff and Helmholtz and began to study Roman Law. A year later, he took up rooms at the Inner Temple and read law at Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the Bar at the end of 1881 and practised the law for a very short time only. Still searching for some direction when he returned to London, Pearson lectured on socialism, Marx and Lassalle at the working men's clubs and on Martin Luther at Hampstead from 1880 to 1881.</p>
<p>By 1882 Pearson had decided that he did not want to pursue the law. From 1882 to 1884, he lectured on German society from the medieval period up to the sixteenth century. He became so competent in German that by the late spring of 1884, he was offered a post in German at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Pearson found all these pursuits dissatisfying and he then began to write some papers on the theory of elastic solids and fluids as well as some mathematical physics papers on optics and ether squirts. Between 1879 and 1884 he applied for more than six mathematical posts and he received the Chair of `Mechanism and Applied Mathematics' at University College London (UCL) in June of 1884.</p>
<p>During Pearson's first six years at UCL, he taught mathematical physics, hydrodynamics, magnetism, electricity and his speciality, elasticity, to engineering students.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>The Gresham Lectures on Geometry and Curve-Fitting</b></p>
<p>Pearson was a founding member of the Men's and Women's Club established in 1885 `for the free and unreserved discussion of all matters in any way connected with the mutual position and relation of men and women'. Among the various members was Marie Sharpe whom he married in June 1890. They had three children, Sigrid, Helga and Egon. Six months after his marriage, he took up another teaching post in the Gresham Chair of Geometry which he held for three years concurrently with his post at UCL. As Gresham Professor, he was responsible for giving 12 lectures a year. These were free to the public. Between February 1891 to November 1893, Pearson delivered 38 lectures. His first eight lectures formed the basis of his book, <i>The Grammar of Science</i> which was published in several languages.</p>
<p>Pearson's earliest teaching of statistics can, in fact, be found in his lecture of 18 November 1891 when he discussed graphical statistics and the mathematical theory of probability with a particular interest in actuarial methods. Two days later he introduced the histogram - a term he coined to designate a 'time-diagram' to be used for historical purposes. He introduced the standard deviation in his Gresham lecture of 31 January 1893. Pearson's early Gresham lectures on statistics were influenced by the work of Edgeworth (q.v.), Jevons (q.v.) and Venn (q.v.). Up until November 1893, these lectures covered fairly conventional statistical and probability methods. Whilst the material in these lectures was not original in content, Pearson's approach in teaching was highly innovative. In one of his lectures, he scattered 10,000 pennies over the lecture room floor and asked his students to count the number of heads or tails.</p>
<p>Pearson's last twelve Gresham Lectures signified a turning-point in his career owing, in particular, to his relationship with Weldon - who was the first biologist Pearson met who was interested in using a statistical approach for problems of Darwinian evolution. Their emphasis on Darwinian population of species not only implied the necessity of systematically measuring variation, but it prompted the re-conceptualisation of statistical populations. Moreover, it was this mathematisation of Darwin which led to a paradigmatic shift for Pearson from the Aristotelian essentialism underpinning the earlier use and development of social and vital statistics. Weldon's questions not only provided the impetus for Pearson's seminal statistical work, but this led eventually to the creation of the Biometric School at UCL.</p>
<p>In Pearson' s first published statistical paper of 26 October 1893, he introduced the method of moments as a means of curve fitting asymmetrical distributions. One of his aims in developing the method of moments was to provide a general method for determining the values of the parameters of a frequency distribution. In 1895 Pearson developed a general formula to use for subsets of six types of frequency curves. In his first supplement in 1901, he defined two further types and a final two were added in his second supplement in 1916. Many of his curves were J-shaped, U-shaped and skewed. Pearson derived all of his curves from a differential equation whose parameters were found from the moments of the distribution. As Churchill Eisenhart remarked in 1974, `Pearson's family of curves did much to dispel the almost religious acceptance of the normal distribution as the mathematical model of variation of biological, physical and social phenomena'.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>The Biometric School</b></p>
<p>Following the success of his Gresham lectures, Pearson began to teach statistics to students at UCL in October of 1894. By 1895 he worked out the mathematical properties of the product-moment correlation coefficient (which measures the relationship between two continuous variables) and simple regression (used for the linear prediction between two continuous variables). By then, Francis Galton had determined graphically the idea of correlation and regression for the normal distribution only.</p>
<p>In this seminal paper on `Regression, Heredity and Panmixia' in 1896, Pearson introduced matrix algebra into statistical theory. In the same paper, Pearson also introduced the following statistical methods: eta (<span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \eta$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/82/l2h/img1.png" title="$ \eta$" width="15" /></span> ) as a measure for a curvilinear relationship, the standard error of an estimate, multiple regression and multiple and partial correlation, and he also devised the coefficient of variation as a measure of the ratio of a standard deviation to the corresponding mean expressed as a percentage.</p>
<p>Pearson introduced various methods of correlation. By the end of the nineteenth century he began to consider the relationship between two discrete variables. In 1900, he devised the tetrachoric correlation and the phi-coefficient for dichotomous variables. The tetrachoric correlation requires that both <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ X$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/82/l2h/img2.png" title="$ X$" width="22" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Y$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/82/l2h/img3.png" title="$ Y$" width="20" /></span> represent continuous, normally distributed and linearly related variables whereas the phi-coefficient was designed for classes having qualitative attributes. Nine years later, he devised the biserial correlation when one variable is continuous and the other is discontinuous. With his son Egon, he devised the polychoric correlation in 1922 (which is very similar to canonical correlation today). Though not all of Pearson's correlational methods have survived him, a number of these methods are still the principal tools used by psychometricians for <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">test</a> construction. Following the publication of his first three statistical papers in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Pearson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1896. He was awarded the Darwin Medal from the Royal Society in 1898.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Pearson's chi-square tests</b></p>
<p>At the turn of the century, Pearson reached a fundamental breakthrough in his development of a modern theory of statistics when he found the exact chi-square distribution from the family of Gamma distributions and devised the chi-square <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ ({\chi}^2 , P)$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/82/l2h/img4.png" title="$ ({\chi}^2 , P)$" width="62" /></span> goodness of fit test. The test was constructed to compare observed frequencies in an empirical distribution with expected frequencies in a theoretical distribution to determine `whether a reasonable graduation had been achieved' (i.e., one with an acceptable probability).</p>
<p>Four years later, he extended this to the analysis of multiple contingency tables and introduced the `mean square contingency coefficient' which he also termed the chi-square test of independence (which R.A. Fisher termed the chi-square statistic in 1923). Pearson's conception of contingency led at once to the generalisation of the notion of the association of two attributes developed by his former student, G. Udny Yule (q.v.). Individuals could now be classed into more than two alternate groups or into many groups with exclusive attributes. The contingency coefficient and the chi-square test of independence could then be used to determine the extent to which two such systems agreed.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Pearson's four laboratories</b></p>
<p>Pearson set up the Drapers' Biometric Laboratory in 1903 following a grant from the Worshipful Drapers' Company (who funded Pearson annually for work in this laboratory until his retirement in 1933).The methodology incorporated in the Drapers' Biometric Laboratory was twofold: the first was mathematical, and included the use of Pearson's statistical methods, matrix algebra and analytical solid geometry. The second involved the use of such instruments as integrators, analysers, curve-plotters, the cranial coordinatograph, silhouettes and cameras. The problems investigated by the biometricians included natural selection, Mendelian genetics and Galton's law of ancestral inheritance, craniometry, physical anthropology and theoretical aspects of mathematical statistics. By 1915, Pearson established the first degree course in mathematical statistics in Britain.</p>
<p>Though Pearson did not accept the generality of Mendelism, he did not reject it completely as is commonly believed. When William Bateson published his fiercely polemical attack on Weldon in 1902, Bateson saw Mendelism as a tool for discontinuous variation only. As a biometrician, most of the variables that Pearson and his co-workers analysed were continuous and only occasionally did they examine discontinuous variables. Whilst Pearson and Weldon used Galton's law of ancestral inheritance for continuous variables, they used Mendelism for discontinuous variables. Indeed, Pearson argued that his chi-square test of independence was the most appropriate statistical tool for the analysis of Mendel's discrete data for dominant and recessive alleles (such as colour of eyes where brown is dominant and blue is recessive). Even today, Pearson's chi-square tests remain the most widely used technique for analysing Mendelian data.</p>
<p>A year after Pearson had established the Biometric Laboratory, the Drapers' Company gave him a grant so that he could establish an Astronomical Laboratory. Pearson was interested in determining the correlations of stellar rotations, and the variability in stellar parallax. He was also instrumental in setting up a degree course in astronomy in 1914 at UCL.</p>
<p>In 1907, Francis Galton (who was then 85 years old) wanted to step down as Director from the Eugenics Record Office which he had set up three years earlier, and he asked Pearson if he would take it on. Pearson agreed reluctantly. He renamed the office the Galton Eugenics Laboratory when he became its director. Pearson made very little use of his biometric methods in this Laboratory; instead he developed a completely different methodology for problems relating to eugenics. This methodology was underpinned by the use of actuarial death rates and by a very highly specialised use of family pedigrees assembled in an attempt to discover the inheritance of various diseases (which included, for example, alcoholism, cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, paralysis and pulmonary tuberculosis). These family pedigrees became the vehicle through which Pearson could communicate statistical ideas to the medical community by stressing the importance of using quantitative methods for medical research. This tool enabled doctors to move away from concentrating on individual pathological cases or `types' and to see, instead, a wide range of pathological variation of the disease (or condition) of the doctors' speciality.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1909, Galton was discussing the future of the Eugenics Laboratory with Pearson. Whilst Galton thought that Pearson would have been `the most suitable man for the first Galton Professor', Pearson let Galton know that he was `wholly unwilling to give up superintendence of the Biometric Laboratory [he] had founded and confine [his] work to Eugenics Research'. A month later, Galton added a codicil to his will stating that he desired that the first Professor of the post should be offered to Pearson on such condition that Pearson could continue to run his Biometric Laboratory. After Galton's death in 1911 Pearson relinquished the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics after 27 years of tenure to take up the Galton Chair. The Drapers' Biometric and the Galton Eugenics laboratories, which continued to receive separate funding, then became incorporated into the Department of Applied Statistics.</p>
<p>Pearson then proceeded to raise funding for a new building for his Department of Applied Statistics. In the early summer of 1914, the new laboratory was complete and preparations were underway for the occupation and fitting up of the public museum and the Anthropometric Laboratory. It was hoped that the building would be occupied by October 1915. These developments and further biometric work were shattered by the onset of the First War. The new laboratory building was taken over by the government to be used as a military hospital. Pearson and his co-workers took on special war duties. They produced statistical charts for the Board of Trade's Labour Department as well as for its Census Production. Pearson was also involved with elaborate calculations of anti-air craft guns and bomb trajectories. It was not until December 1922 that Pearson's building was reoccupied.</p>
<p>His wife, Marie Sharpe, died in 1928 and in 1929 he married Margaret Victoria Child, a co-worker in the Biometric Laboratory. Pearson was made Emeritus Professor in 1933. From his retirement until his death in 1936, he published 34 articles and notes and continued to edit <i>Biometrika</i>. Pearson was offered an OBE in 1920 and a knighthood in 1933, but he refused both honours. He also declined the Royal Statistical Society Guy Medal in their centenary year in 1934. Pearson believed that `all medals and honours should be given to young men, they encourage them when they begin to doubt whether their work was of value'.<br />

<p><b>Edwin James George PITMAN</b><br />
b. 29 October 1897 - d. 21 July 1993<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> The Australian, Edwin Pitman, made rigorous yet applicable contributions to theory in areas as diverse as non-parametric inference and the properties of characteristic functions; concepts such as `closeness' and `asymptotic relative efficiency' were developed by him.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Edwin James George Pitman was born in Melbourne, Victoria and died at Kingston near Hobart, Tasmania. In his final year, at school, he gained not only the Wyselaskie and Dixson Scholarships in Mathematics, but also a scholarship to Ormond College at the University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>He graduated B.A. (1921), B.Sc. (1922) and M.A. (1923). In the meantime he was appointed Acting Professor of Mathematics at Canterbury College, University of New Zealand (1922-23). He returned to Australia when appointed Tutor in Mathematics and Physics at Trinity and Ormond Colleges and Part-time Lecturer in Physics at the University of Melbourne (1924-25). In 1926 Pitman was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Tasmania, a position he held until his retirement in 1962.</p>
<p>About two years after his appointment to the Chair, an experimenter at the State Department of Agriculture brought Pitman some data and statistical analyses from field trials on potatoes, together with a copy of R.A. Fisher's (q.v.) <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i>. Pitman checked the calculations and studied the Fisher book, which led to continuing collaboration with the Department of Agriculture on its field trials. Pitman later [11] described himself as 'a mathematician who strayed into Statistics'.</p>
<p>Pitman was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1954, in the first group of elected Fellows. In 1956 he was active in the formation of the Australian Mathematical Society.</p>
<p>He was a renowned member of the Statistical Society of Australia, and elected an Honorary Life Member in 1966. In 1978 the Statistical Society established the Pitman Medal `for high distinction in Statistics' and awarded Pitman the first of these medals.</p>
<p>Pitman's published work comprises 21 papers and a monograph. Much of his research has been presented in lectures and in other ways. The published work has been very influential, in clarifying the underlying ideas of inference and in defining new and relevant concepts.</p>
<p>Pitman's 1936 paper [3] defines the class of probability distributions that admits a complete sufficient statistic and also gives a critical account of the related concepts of information and intrinsic accuracy. It yields priority to Darmois (q.v.) (1935), which however is a mere statement of results. In later work [9, 10], Pitman discusses the limits on accuracy of estimation and the inapplicability of the information concept in non-regular cases.</p>
<p>His two papers [7, 8] on inference about location and scale parameters are classics; they define clearly the class of continuous distributions to which the theory may be applied and the limitations to which the inferences drawn from the analysis are subject.</p>
<p>Pitman presented the first systematic account of non-parametric inference [4, 5, 6] and lectured extensively on the subject, both in Australia and in the United States. In [4], he writes, `The approach to the subject, starting from the sample and working towards the population instead of the reverse, may be a bit of a novelty'; and later, `the essential point of the method is that we do not have to worry about the populations which we do not know, but only about the sample values which we do know'.</p>
<p>The notes of the `Lectures on Non-parametric Inference' given in the United States, though never published, have been widely circulated and have had a major impact on the development of the subject.</p>
<p>A major contribution to probability theory is his elegant treatment of the behaviour of the characteristic function in the neighbourhood of the origin. This governs such properties as the existence of moments.</p>
<p>In his research, Pitman was concerned, not only to advance the theory, but also to put the results in a form readily accessible to the user. In his treatment of the Cramér-Rao Inequality [9], for instance, he states, `we want to apply the Cramér-Rao inequality to statistics that we do not know, and so the regularity conditions should ask as little as possible of the statistic <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ S$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/83/l2h/img1.png" title="$ S$" width="17" /></span> ... and should be mainly concerned with the family of measures which we know completely'. Elsewhere [11] he remarks `Regularity conditions for theoretical results are often flung down with scant regard for the possible user. They are often too strong, and they are often difficult to verify in actual cases'.</p>
<p>Pitman was much in demand as a visiting lecturer, especially in the United States. In 1948-49, he was invited to visit Columbia University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Princeton. His next visit to the United States was in 1957, when he was appointed a Visiting Professor at Stanford.</p>
<p>In 1963 he visited Berkeley, and then John Hopkins in Baltimore. He spent 1965 at the University of Adelaide. For 1966 and 1967, the University of Melbourne appointed him as Visiting Professor, where he did further work on the behaviour of characteristic functions, as well as exploring some novel properties of the Cauchy distribution. In 1969 he visited the University of Chicago. At the University of Dundee in 1973 and at Melbourne in 1974 he put the finishing touches to the monograph [10].</p>
<p>No chronicle of Edwin Pitman's life and achievements would be complete without due recognition of the contribution of his wife Elinor. She and Edwin were married on 7 January 1932. They resided in a large sandstone house, then on the outskirts of Hobart, where Elinor was able to create a tranquil home environment in which Edwin could carry on his work. They had four children: Jane, now Reader in Mathematics at the University of Adelaide; Mary (Mrs John Baldwin), Professor of Environmental Science at Concordia University, Montréal; Edwin Arthur (Ted), a civil engineer with the Tasmanian Department of Main Roads; and James, Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<p><b>Andrei Andreevich MARKOV</b><br />
b. 2 June 1856 (o.s.) - d. 20 July 1922<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Markov, with Liapunov a disciple of Chebyshev, gave rigorous proofs of the Central Limit Theorem. Through his work on Markov chains, the concept of Markovian dependence pervades modern theory and application of random processes. His textbook influenced the development of probability and statistics internationally.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Markov was born in Ryazan, and died in Petrograd (which was - before the revolution, and is now again - called St. Petersburg). He was a poor student in all but mathematics at the fifth Petersburg gymnasium which he entered in 1866. Already during this period he revealed an emotional and uncompromising nature which was to surface in clashes with the tsarist regime and academic colleagues, even though his motives were generally high-minded. He was, however, more fortunate in his circumstances than his similarly volatile younger countryman E.E. Slutsky (q.v.) in that Markov had influential senior colleagues who understood and tolerated him, among whom V.A. Steklov is mentioned frequently; and in that he worked in the capital city of the Russian Empire.</p>
<p>Entering Petersburg University in 1874, he attended classes in the Physico-Mathematical Faculty by A.N. Korkin, E.I. Zolotarev and P.L. Chebyshev (q.v.), all of whom encouraged him and facilitated his progress. At the completion of his studies in 1878 he received a gold medal and was retained by the university to prepare for a career as an academic, in the tradition of the times with the best students.</p>
<p>With the departure of Chebyshev from the university in 1883, Markov took over his course in probability which he continued to teach yearly. Markov's doctoral dissertation <i>On Some Applications of Algebraic Continued Fractions</i>, results from which were published in 1884, already had implicit connections with probability theory inasmuch as it treated certain inequalities published by Chebyshev in 1874 in Liouville's <i>J. Math. Pures Appl.</i>, relating to the method of moments which Chebyshev had in turn extracted from notions of I.J. Bienaymé (q.v.). At the proposal of Chebyshev, Markov was elected to the St. Petersburg Academy of Science in 1886, attaining full membership in 1896. With A.M. Liapunov, Markov became the most eminent of Chebyshev's disciples in probability of the Petersburg “School", and remained closest to his teacher's ideas. The writings of Markov and Liapunov placed probability on the level of an exact mathematical science. Markov's published probabilistic work has in much of its background correspondence with A.V. Vasiliev, professor at Kazan University, a graduate of the same Petersburg gymnasium, and also a student of Chebyshev. Indeed several important papers of Markov, including the one in which “Markov chains" first appear in Markov's writings in 1906, were published in the <i>Izvestiia (Bulletin)</i> of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Kazan University.</p>
<p>The initial impetus for Markov's work in probability theory was Chebyshev's proof, which was incomplete, of the Central Limit Theorem. Bouncing his ideas off Vasiliev, Markov begins in 1898 by replacing one of Chebyshev's conditions, while persisting with Chebyshev's approach via the method of moments. Liapunov's Theorem on the Central Limit problem, published in 1901, differs not only in its approach (by characteristic functions, originating with Cauchy and I.V. Sleshinsky (1854-1931)) but also in its level of generality. This motivated Markov to wonder whether the method of moments might not be suitably adapted to give the same result; and he finally achieved this in 1913 in the 3rd edition of his <i>Ischislenie Veroiatnostei (Calculus of Probabilites)</i>.</p>
<p>Markov was embroiled in several controversies with the Moscow mathematician P.A. Nekrasov (1853-1924), one of which led (Seneta, 1984, 1996) to Markov's outstanding contribution to probability theory, the concept of chain dependence of random variables. The first of these controversies was initiated by a probabilistic paper of Nekrasov in 1898, dedicated to Chebyshev (!) and containing no proofs. It was followed by about 1,000 pages of obscure and verbose argument in <i>Matematicheskii Sbornik</i>. In its attempt to establish now-standard local and global theorems of Central Limit type for large deviations, this work of Nekrasov was ahead of its time, but was only partly successful. Its specific inaccuracies were criticised by Markov and Liapunov, who never understood the general direction; the task of so doing was formidable. Moreover, in the course of these writings in 1902 Nekrasov claimed that pairwise independence of summands was a necessary condition for the Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN) to hold. He had examined, he said, the “logical underpinnings" of the way the Bienaymé-Chebyshev Inequality was used to prove the WLLN. The <i>observed</i> stability of averages in everyday life, through the claimed consequent necessity of pairwise independence, justified the doctrine of free will. It was this attempt to use mathematics and statistics in support of theological doctrine which led Markov to construct a scheme of <i>dependent</i> random variables in his Kazan paper, which ends, without ever mentioning Nekrasov explicitly, with the words</p>
<blockquote>“Thus, independence of quantities does not constitute a necessary condition for existence of the law of large numbers."</blockquote>
<p>It was in 1902 also that Markov protested over the reversal by the tsar of election as Honorary Member of the Academy of Science of A.M. Gorky (Peshkov). Markov refused subsequently to accept any awards (“orders") from the Academy, or to act as “agent of the government" in relation to students at the university. He came into conflict with the Council of Petersburg University in 1905 about the procedure for relaxing the quota on admission of Jews. In 1912 when the Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church excommunicated Leo Tolstoy, Markov likewise requested excommunication. His character and beliefs in combination with his scientific eminence were very acceptable to the incoming political system following the October revolution in 1917, and contributed in having the Petersburg School put into exclusive eminence in Soviet mathematical historiography (in contrast to the Moscow School, of which Nekrasov and later Egorov and Luzin were members).</p>
<p>The same historiographic tendencies have progressively ascribed the Bienaymé-Chebyshev Inequality and the method of moments to Chebyshev alone. But just as Chebyshev in the 1874 paper had given Bienaymé due credit, so Markov too was ever a defender of Bienaymé's priority. In response to a statement of Nekrasov that the idea of Bienaymé is exhausted in the works of Chebyshev who, Nekrasov continues, himself had remarked on this in 1874, Markov in 1912 writes (characteristically)</p>
<blockquote>“The reference here to Chebyshev is misleading, and the statement of P.A. Nekrasov that the idea of Bienaymé is exhausted is contradicted by a sequence of my papers containing a generalization of the method of Bienaymé to settings which are not even touched on in the writings of P.A. Nekrasov."</blockquote>
<p>The first of these papers which he lists is the Kazan paper of 1906, written to contradict Nekrasov's assertions about the necessity of pairwise independence for the WLLN.</p>
<p>Markov retired from the university in 1905, but continued to teach probability theory there. From 1904 to 1915 he wrote letters to newspapers on current social issues, and especially on education (Sheynin, 1989); the press coined for him the name <i>Neistovy Andrei (Andrew the Furious)</i>. In 1915 he opposed the programme proposed by P.S. Florov and Markov's continuing bête noir Nekrasov about changes to the school mathematics syllabus. There are good biographies of Markov, most notably by his son (Markov, 1951) and Grodzensky (1987).</p>
<p>It is, however, his views of and contributions to statistics which deserve to be addressed also.</p>
<p>On his retirement from the university, continuing to seek practical applications of probability theory, he participated from the beginning in deliberations on running the retirement fund of the Ministry of Justice, following in the footsteps of his probabilistic predecessors V. Ya. Buniakovsky, M.V. Ostrogradsky and Bienaymé.</p>
<p>Markov's attention was turned to mathematical statistics through his correspondence (Ondar, 1981) with Chuprov (q.v.) which begins 2 November 1910 with a postcard to the latter criticizing him for mentioning Nekrasov's name in the same breath as Chebyshev's, in Chuprov's erudite <i>Ocherki po Teorii Statistiki (Topics in the Theory of Statistics)</i> of 1909, which had just come to Markov's attention. From such inauspicious beginnings, in which Markov, claiming to judge all work only from a strictly mathematical point of view, dismissed the work of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.) amongst others, grew a lively correspondence on the topic of dispersion theory. At the same time as the interests of the statistician Chuprov were turned progressively to a mathematical direction, Markov's negative attitude to statistics softened, and in the end, out of the correspondence came elegant and important theoretical contributions from both (Heyde and Seneta, 1977, Section 3.4). Indeed, the correspondence marks the coming together in the Russian Empire of probability and statistics into mathematical statistics. The correspondence ends in early 1917. In the course of it, Markov was led in 1913 to modelling the alternation of vowels and consonants in several Russian literary works by a two-state Markov chain and estimation in the model using dispersion-theoretic ideas.</p>
<p>Markov was also interested, through the influence of Chebyshev, in the classical linear model which he treated in his <i>Ischislenie Veroiatnostei</i> in various editions. The inappropriate name “Gauss-Markov theorem" seems ultimately to arise from these treatments.</p>
<p>Markov's Inequality is the name given to the result <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(Y \geq a) \leq EY/a$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/67/l2h/img1.png" title="$ P(Y \geq a) \leq EY/a$" width="157" /></span> where <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Y$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/67/l2h/img2.png" title="$ Y$" width="20" /></span> is a non-negative random variable and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ a &gt; 0$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/67/l2h/img3.png" title="$ a &gt; 0$" width="49" /></span> . It appeared in the 1913 edition of Markov's <i>Ischislenie Veroiatnostei</i>, and is more fundamental than the Bienaymé-Chebyshev Inequality, although the simple proof used by Bienaymé can be modified to prove it also.<br />

<p><b>William PLAYFAIR</b><br />
b. 22 September 1759 - d. 11 February 1823<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> William Playfair, engineer, political economist and scoundrel, was the most important developer of statistical graphics. In the two centuries since, there has been no appreciable improvement on his basic designs.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>William Playfair was born at Liff in Scotland during the Enlightenment - a Golden Age in the arts, sciences, industry and commerce. He died in London, in 1823, after an eventful life, though unmarked at the time by any apparently significant or memorable contribution. He made little impression in his native land, and his impact was only slightly greater in England and France. Yet he is responsible for inventions familiar and useful to us all: he was the first to devise and publish all of the common statistical graphs - the pie chart, the bar chart, and the statistical line graph. He invented a universal language useful to science and commerce alike and though his contemporaries failed to grasp the significance, Playfair had no doubt that he had forever changed the way we would look at data. Over a span of thirty six years he published many books and pamphlets containing statistical charts and though this work was received with indifference, even hostility, he never faltered in his conviction that he had found the best way to display empirical data. However, it took almost a century after his death before his invention was fully accepted.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of Playfair's innovations, his name is largely unknown, even to professional statisticians, and those who have heard of him know little of his life. One might expect a life of the inventor of statistical graphs to make dull reading, but Playfair pursued a variety of careers with such passion, ambition, industry, and optimism that even without his great inventions, he would be judged a colorful figure. He was, in turn, millwright, engineer, draftsman, accountant, inventor, silversmith, merchant, investment broker, economist, statistician, pamphleteer, translator, publicist, land speculator, convict, banker, ardent royalist, journalist, editor, and blackmailer. His business activities were sometimes questionable, if not downright illegal, and it may fairly be said that he was something of a rogue and scoundrel (Spence &amp; Wainer (1998)).</p>
<p>A touch of the scoundrel, or at least of the iconoclast, was an important component in the character of anyone who was to develop statistical graphics. The Cartesian tradition of graphical representation of mathematical functions worked against the use of graphs to depict empirical regularities. The switch to the view that a graph can help us formulate an understanding of nature by plotting data and looking for patterns required, in Thomas Kuhn's terms, a shift in paradigm. A person that might effect such a change would not only require the appropriate intellectual and technical background, but would also have to disregard the standards of an academic scientific community that was firmly opposed to illustration in serious writing. In all aspects Playfair fit the bill.</p>
<p>William Playfair was the fourth son of the Reverend James Playfair of the parish of Liff &amp; Benvie near the City of Dundee, Scotland. His father died in 1772 leaving the eldest brother John to care for the family. John was subsequently to become one of Britain's foremost mathematicians and scientists as Professor of Natural Philosophy, Mathematics, and Geology at Edinburgh University. After an apprenticeship at the Houston Mill with Andrew Meikle, the inventor of the threshing machine, William became draftsman and personal assistant to the great James Watt at the steam engine manufactory of Boulton &amp; Watt at Birmingham in 1777. Thus his scientific and engineering training was at the hands of the leading figures of the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution. On leaving Boulton &amp; Watt in 1782, Playfair set up a silversmithing business and shop in London, but the venture soon failed. Seeking his fortune and hoping to apply his engineering skills to better effect in a developing French economy, Playfair moved to Paris in 1787. He was involved in more than just business in a Paris that was about to undergo revolutionary change. Playfair was one of the approximately twelve hundred inhabitants of the St. Antoine quarter who formed themselves into a militia and assisted in the storming and capture of the Bastille <a href="#foot70" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a>.</p>
<p>In February of 1791 he rescued his friend, the well-known ex-judge, Duval d'Epremesnil from the mob in the Palais Royal Gardens; see Spence &amp; Wainer (1998) for a fuller description of this adventure. He was also a principal in the Scioto debacle - a failed scheme projected to settle migrants between the Ohio and Scioto rivers - about which was said, “some hundreds of unfortunate families were lured to destruction by the picture of a salubrious climate and fertile soil."<a href="#foot42" id="tex2html2" name="tex2html2"><sup><span class="arabic">2</span></sup></a>Whether on account of alleged mismanagement and embezzlement, or, as Playfair contends, because of his plain speaking against the revolutionaries, Playfair left Paris for Frankfurt in something of a hurry shortly after this adventure.</p>
<p>In 1793, while in Frankfurt, he heard a description of the semaphore telegraph from a French emigre. The following day he built a model of the apparatus and sent it to the Duke of York. He thereafter claimed to have introduced the semaphore into England. although it seems that his major contribution was the introduction of a new alphabet for the device <a href="#foot43" id="tex2html3" name="tex2html3"><sup><span class="arabic">3</span></sup></a></p>
<p>When he returned to London Playfair opened a `security bank', intended to ease the granting of small loans by subdividing large securities, but this soon collapsed after a conflict with the Bank of England. From the mid-1790s onward he made his living principally as a writer and pamphleteer. Although initially positive, he argued vehemently against the excesses of the French Revolution and wrote frequently on the topic of British policy towards France. He claimed credit for warning of Napoleon's escape from Elba - a warning which the British government ignored. His illustrated British Family Antiquity was a massive nine volume undertaking in which he catalogued the peerage and baronetage of the United Kingdom - a work principally designed to raise money by subscription. He dabbled in journalism, editing more than one periodical, the best known of which may be the <i>Tomahawk</i>. After the restoration of the Bourbons he returned to Paris as editor of the periodical <i>Galignani's Messenger</i>, but in 1818 his comments on a duel between Colonel Duffay and Comte de St. Morys were held to be libelous by the widow and daughter of the latter and led to prosecution. Playfair was sentenced to three months imprisonment, three hundred francs fine, and one thousand francs damages. To avoid incarceration he left France and spent his few remaining years in London writing pamphlets and doing translations. The final two years saw a renewed interest in economics and his final publications include several charts, including one or two rather fine examples that combined the line graph, bar chart, and chronological diagram in a single chart. His interest in agricultural matters was the stimulus for his last two works which examined the difficulties experienced by English farmers in the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>A common theme throughout Playfair's life was his practical inventiveness. He had a first class knowledge of engineering practice based largely on his experience in Matthew Boulton's manufactory - the world's first modern factory. He took out several patents, mostly involving machines for metal working, including a patent for the first mass-produced silver-plated spoon, but he also proposed innovations such as modifications to the bows of ships to make them faster and improvements to agricultural implements. When he was confronted by a problem he would invariably offer a practical solution - this would often involve the application or adaptation of what he already knew to work well in other situations. Of equal importance was his insistence in recording his proposal. For example, about his arrival in Germany in 1793 he wrote (Spence (1996)),</p>
<blockquote>“When I was in Germany I was surprised that in a country where the milk is excellent the butter was little better than common grease without anything either of the colour or taste that good butter possesses. But one day in changing horses where the post master spoke a little French and had a farm I asked to see the dairy when I found that the milk was kept in deep narrow jars about three feet deep and eight or nine inches wide. The cream that rose to the top was about three inches in depth before it was taken off and though not quite rancid had a disagreeable smell. I advised him to get wide shallow vessels and keep them very clean but he smiled as if I knew nothing of the business. I asked him if the Dutch butter was not better than theirs. He owned it was. I apprised him that the Dutch milk was not so good as the German and that the excellence of the Dutch butter proceeded from the better mode of keeping the milk. He did not attempt to answer my reasoning but gave his head a significant shake and no doubt unless the French soldiers carried them into a better method in Germany they still persist in the same."</blockquote>
<p>In his political and economic writings he often used numerical examples and calculations to make a point, frequently demonstrating the impossibility or absurdity of a commonly held opinion by such calculation. He found that making sense of empirical information was aided enormously by the use of statistical graphics and he believed passionately that graphs, not tables, were the best route to communication and understanding. He used, refined, and adapted those graphical forms that were known to him from mathematics and the natural sciences and invented others. He was the first to use line graphs to portray economic data, including the use of area to depict surplus and deficit; he adapted Priestley's chronological charts to produce the first statistical graph that did not incorporate time as a variable - the bar chart. He created the pie chart and circle diagram seemingly with no intellectual precursors. He was the first to use hachure, shading, and color, thus incorporating elements of classification into the quantitative depiction. The quality and detail of his work was such that in the two centuries since there has been no appreciable improvement of his basic designs. His contributions to the development and demonstrations of the use of statistical graphics in several publications between 1786 and 1822 remain his life's principal accomplishment.</p>
<p>In 1786 he published his Commercial and Political Atlas which contained 44 line graphs and a solitary bar chart (but no maps). This was the first description of his graphical inventions and is the first major work of any kind to contain statistical graphs. It met with limited initial success in England, but fared rather differently in France. Playfair reports <a href="#foot48" id="tex2html4" name="tex2html4"><sup><span class="arabic">4</span></sup></a></p>
<blockquote>“When I went to France in 1787, I found several copies there, and amongst others, one which had been sent by an English nobleman to the Monsieur de Vergennes, which copy he presented to the king, who being well acquainted with the study of geography, understood it readily, and expressed great satisfaction. This circumstance was of service to me, when I afterwards solicited an exclusive privilege for a certain manufactory, which I obtained. The work was translated into French, and the Academy of Sciences, testified its approbation of this application of geometry to accounts, and gave me a general invitation to attend its meetings in the Louvre; and at the same time did me the honour of seating me by the president during that sitting."</blockquote>
<p>In his unpublished memoirs written shortly before his death (Spence (1996)), Playfair adds, “As his majesty made Geography a study, he at once understood the charts and was highly pleased. He said they spoke all languages and were very clear and easily understood." The extraordinary growth in the use and popularity of statistical graphics in the two centuries since their introduction suggests that Louis XVI 's judgment, in this area at least, was quite correct.<br />

<p><b>Thomas Robert MALTHUS</b><br />
b. 14 February 1766 - d. 23 December 1834<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Malthus was a pivotal figure in the development of the empirical study of human populations as a field of intellectual investigation.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>T R Malthus, English economist, statistician and demographer, was born at Guilford, Surrey. His father was a prosperous country gentleman with intellectual interests, who was a friend and admirer of both David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Under the influence of Rousseau's <i>Emile</i>, the father arranged for Malthus and his brother to be educated at various private schools. At the age of 18, Robert Malthus entered Jesus College Cambridge, where he was elected a fellow in 1797. Malthus is best known for his <i>Essay on the Principle of Population</i>, the central theme of which was that there was an inherent tendency for human numbers to `outstrip the means of subsistence', and that human improvement therefore depended on stern limits on reproduction. The original essay, published anonymously in 1798, was directed against the optimistic speculations of certain utopian writers who could see no limit to human progress. It brought Malthus immediate fame, but also notoriety among those who believed that the young clergyman's doctrine amounted to a questioning of divine providence. In <i>Essays In Biography</i> (1933), the British economist <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=56" name="menu0">John Maynard Keynes</a> (q.v.) was to write of this pamphlet that</p>
<blockquote>The voice of objective reason had been raised against a deep instinct which the evolutionary struggle had been implanting from the commencement of life; and man's mind, in the conscious pursuit of happiness, was daring to demand the reins of government from out of the hands of the unconscious urge for mere predominant survival.</blockquote>
<p>There were not many statistics in the first book, though Malthus did draw upon the estimates of the numbers of births and deaths which had been made or quoted during the preceding century by his countrymen Gregory King, Thomas Short and Richard Price. Perhaps because of the stir which his book created, Malthus immediately settled down to a thorough examination of all of the available information bearing upon the principle which he had enunciated. The result, published in 1803 in Malthus' own name, was a book of nearly four times the length of the original essay. In <i>The Economics of Industry</i> (1896), another British economist, Alfred Marshall, was to rate this book as `one of the most crushing answers that patient and hard-working science has ever given to the reckless assertions of its adversaries'.</p>
<p>In 1805 Malthus was appointed professor of history and political economy at the new East India College, a chair which he was to occupy until his death almost thirty years later. In addition to producing important works in political economy, the originality of which came to be increasingly recognised in the twentieth century, Malthus continued to refine his study of the principle of population in further editions of the <i>Essay</i>, including in appendices to the 1806 and 1817 editions in which he sought `to correct some of the misrepresentations which have gone abroad respecting two or three of the most important points of the <i>Essay</i>'.</p>
<p>Increasingly, Malthus' <i>Essay</i> became an empirical and statistical work. In a recent assessment in <i>The Rise of Political Economy as a Science</i> (1997), Deborah Redman notes that Malthus `culled evidence from every region in the world, every period of history, and every stage in society', and that he 'was familiar with the life expectancy tables of Euler, Barton, Sussmilch (q.v.), Milne and others'. Redman recognises, however, that Malthus' use of statistics was not always above criticism.</p>
<p>The most succinct statement of Malthus' mature views on population issues appeared in his article on `Population' in the 1824 Supplement to the <i>Encyclopaedia Brittanica</i>, which was issued separately in 1830, with a few amendments, as <i>A Summary View of the Principle of Population</i>. In this work, Malthus makes extensive use of population, vital statistics and baptism and burial records relating to the United States, Latin America and a number of European countries.</p>
<p>In his declining years, Malthus was active in the promotion of statistics as a profession and as a discipline. On 27 June 1833, in the course of a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Cambridge, he took the chair at a meeting of eight `Gentlemen desirous of forming a Statistical Section of the ... Association'. He was also a founding member of the (London) Royal Society of Statistics in the following year. In Population Malthus (1979), Malthus' biographer, Patricia James, records that his `pursuit of accurate statistics and their correct interpretation [were] ... among the intellectual passions in his life'.</p>
<p>Malthus married in 1804. His family life seems to have been extremely happy. The Malthuses had three children, of whom the younger daughter, to their great grief, died in 1825 at age 17. Malthus died on 23 December 1834, while on a visit to his wife's family in Bath. His last words on the subject of population survive in a letter of thanks to an unknown Jacqueline. Writing three months before his death to a young lady who had apparently spoken up in his defence, Britain's first professor of political economy said that he was glad that she had vindicated him `against the accusation of massacring children', and urged her to point out that `I have specifically proposed as the best criterion of the happiness and good government of a country the number of the children born who arrive at the age of puberty.'</p>
<p>In his introduction to the eight-volume edition of the collected works (1986), the English historical demographer E A Wrigley recognised Malthus' seminal contribution to population studies:</p>
<blockquote>... Malthus bestowed life on population studies as a field of intellectual investigation by showing how strategic to the understanding of the functioning of society a knowledge of its demography might be. ... His range of interests was so catholic and his penetration so acute that few social scientists today, as yesterday, should fail to be stimulated by reading his works.</blockquote>
<p>Recently, Caldwell (1998) argues that Malthus, whether right or wrong, has been very influential, in the later 20th Century, on the policies which have been adopted by the developing world.<br />

<p><b>Prasanta Chandra MAHALANOBIS</b><br />
b. 29 June 1893 - d. 28 June 1972<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> A father figure in Indian Statistics, Mahalanobis is well-known for his <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ D^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/65/l2h/img1.png" title="$ D^2$" width="28" /></span> statistic and pioneering contributions to large scale sample surveys. He is also remembered for his historic role in modernizing the Indian Statistical System, applications including dams and 5 year economic plans and contributions to Statistical Systems of other countries as Chair of the UN Subcommission on Statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>A biographer of Mahalanobis has desribed him as a Renaissance man and scientist. He could also be described as a child of a renaissance. In spirit, if not quite in time, his roots may be traced to the Bengal Renaissance, a social and cultural awakening that shook the province of Bengal in nineteenth century India. Prasanta Chandra Manalanobis's grandfather founded, with others, an organization called the <i>Sadharan Brahmo Samaj</i> , which was to become a torch-bearer of the Bengal Renaissance. His father, Probodh Chandra, was an active member of this organization. his mother, Nirodbasini, belonged to a family of considerable academic achievements. Into this family, Prasanta Chandra was born on 29 June 1893.</p>
<p>Prasanta Chandra completed his schooling in Calcutta in 1908. In 1912, he graduated with honors in Physics from Presidency College, Calcutta. He went to England in 1915 and completed Tripos in Mathematics and Physics from Kings College, Cambridge. In Part II of the Tripos, he was the only candidate to get a first class in Physics. King's College awarded him a senior research fellowship. Before starting his research, he came to Calcutta for a short vacation, but never returned to England. The war intervened. Also, he had found a teaching job and plenty of other interesting things to do in Calcutta.</p>
<p>Just before Mahalanobis left Cambridge, his tutor, W.H. Macaulay, drew his attention to <i>Biometrika</i>. Mahalanobis found the articles interesting, purchased the whole set of available volumes and brought back to Calcutta. A window was opened to a new area of science, permanently changing the direction of his life.</p>
<p>Among his mentors in Calcutta was Acharya Brojendranath Seal, a philosopher and an encyclopaedist, who was also interested in statistics. Seal was to have a lasting influence on Mahalanobis's life and work. In 1917, Seal, who held the Chair of Philosophy in Calcutta University, sought the help of Mahalanobis in analyzing examination results of the University. Soon thereafter, Mahalanobis met Nelson Annandale, the then Director of Zoological and Anthorpological Survey of India, who had collected anthropometric measurements on Anglo-Indians of Calcutta. Annandale requested Mahalanobis to analyze the data. The results of statistical analyses of a portion of these data resulted in Mahalanobis's first paper on statistics entitled “Anthropological Observations on Anglo-Indians of Calcutta, Part I: Male Stature", published in <i>Records of the Indian Museum</i> in 1922. This paper attracted the attention of Sir Gilbert Walker, Director General of Observatories, who requested Mahalanobis to undertake a systematic study of some meteorological problems. This resulted in an important discovery by Mahalanobis that the region of highest control for changes in weather on the surface of the earth was located about 4 kms. above sea-level. Subsequently, he was appointed Meteorologist in the Alipore Observatory and he held this post from 1922 to 1926.</p>
<p>Some of the early statistical studies he undertook were on experimental designs in agriculture. In 1924, he made some important discoveries pertaining to the probable error of results of agricultural experiments, which put him in touch with R.A. Fisher (q.v.). Later in 1926, he met Fisher at the Rothamsted Experimental Station and a close personal relationship was immediately established which lasted until Fisher's death.</p>
<p>At the request of the Indian Government, Mahalanobis undertook some work on prevention of floods in various regions of the country. His findings and recommendations, though often contrary to engineering wisdom of the time, were accepted by the Government and resulted in alleviation of the problem of flooding to a large extent.</p>
<p>In 1927, Mahalanobis spent a few months in <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a>'s (q.v.) laboratory in London, during which period he performed extensive statistical analyses of anthropometric data and closely examined Pearson's Coefficient of Racial Likeness (CRL) for measurement of biological affinities. He noted several shortcomings of the CRL and in 1930 published his seminal paper on the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ D^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/65/l2h/img2.png" title="$ D^2$" width="28" /></span> -statistic entitled “<a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">Tests</a> and measures of group divergence". Mahalanobis's interest in anthropometry remained strong and two large-scale anthropometric surveys were carried out under his direction in the United Provinces and Bengal. Based primarily on the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ D^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/65/l2h/img3.png" title="$ D^2$" width="28" /></span> -statistic, many of the important anthropological inferences drawn from the data collected in these surveys have stood the test of time. For example, the conclusion that Bengal Brahmins resemble other castes of Bengal more closely than they resemble Brahmins from elsewhere in India, has been corroborated by many subsequent studies.</p>
<p>Mahalanobis's contributions to large scale sample surveys are among his most significant and lasting gifts to statistics. He started his work on sample surveys with estimation of area and yield of jute crop in Bengal in 1937. However, it was not easy for him to get these estimates accepted; controversy between him and the advocates of complete enumeration continued for over a decade. Untimately he was able to demonstrate that estimates based on sample surveys were often more accurate than those based on complete enumeration, and that sample surveys could yield estimates with small margins of error within a short time and at a smaller cost than complete enumeration. He made many methodological contributions to survey sampling that included optimal choice of sampling design using variance and cost functions, and the technique of interpenetrating network of sub-samples for assessment and control of errors, especially non-sampling errors, in surveys. The concept of pilot surveys was a forerunner of sequential sampling developed by Abraham Wald, as acknowledged by Wald in his book. In addition to introducing these concepts, Mahalanobis raised important and difficult philosophical questions on random-ness and representativeness of a sample, which remain relevant and challenging even today. He was elected Chairman of the United Nations Sub-Commission on Statistical Sampling in 1947, and held this post until 1951. His tireless advocacy of the usefulness of sample surveys resulted in the final recommendation of this Sub-commision that sampling methods should be extended to all parts of the world. Mahalanobis received the Weldon Medal from Oxford university in 1944 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1945, for his fundamental contributions to Statistics, particularly in the area of large-scale sample surveys.</p>
<p>Mahalanobis believed that statistics in an integral part of the dynamics of national planning. He was acutely aware of national problems and national resources. He took a keen interest and played a key role in formulating India's second five-year plan based on the "four-sector model" developed by him. Broad sectoral allocations of employment, capital investment and increment in national income were worked out and then split into detailed targets. Even though national planning seems to have now fallen out of favour, the need for planning in the initial stages of a nation's development is still acknowledged and Mahalanobis's contributions to Indian national planning continue to be held in high esteem by economists. During the last decade of his life, he devised a statistical method, fractile graphical analysis, for comparison of socio-economic conditions of groups of people. This technique has now been used in many other branches of science.</p>
<p>The year 1931 marks a watershed in the development of statistics in India. From the fledgling Statistical Laboratory formed in the early 1920's by Mahalanobis within the Physics department of Presidency College, he founded the Indian Statistical Institute on 17 December 1931. He persuaded many bright young physicists and mathematicians to join the Institute. They included Raj Chandra Bose, Samarendranth Roy and C. Radhakrishna Rao. He and his wife, Nirmalkumari, poured in all they possessed to establish the Institute on a firm footing. In 1959, by an act of the Indian Parliament, the Institute was declared as an “Institution of National Importance".</p>
<p>Mahalanobis's role as a planner prompted him to play a pioneering role in the organized collection of official statistics. He established the National Sample Survey in 1950 with the objective of providing comprehensive statistics relating to all economic and social aspects on an all-India basis. He helped in the setting up of the Central Statistical Organization in India, an apex body for coordination of statistical activities in India. he was instrumental in the establishment of formal teaching of statistics in many Indian universities and also in the Indian Statistical Institute. In collaboration with the International Statistical Institute, he established an International Statistical Education Centre at the Indian Statistical Institute.</p>
<p>Mahalanobis became the Honorary President of the International Statistical Institute in 1957, and was elected a Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 1961. Throughout his career he received many other academic honors and awards. He received the highest national honor, <i>Padma Vibhusan</i> , from the President of India in 1968.</p>
<p>As a scientist Mahalanobis was, above all, a great applied statistician. Statistics was to be used for better understanding and reporting of scientific and engineering data and decision making for welfare of the society. In Mahalanobis's work on prevention of floods, both aspects of statistics, namely, understanding and decision making, come together. On the other hand in his pioneering work on anthropometric variation in India, it is the first aspect that dominates.</p>
<p>In his work as an applied statistician, Mahalanobis was very innovative, often introducing new concepts or methodologies or systematizations. His work on flood control combined innovative data analysis, understanding and modeling natural phenomena, and a systematization of the whole complex analysis which made his recommendations so readily acceptable to the government. The same gift for innovation and systematization are apparent in his work on large-scale sample surveys and planning. For him, theory grew out of a practical need and thus influenced subsequent practical work. He had nothing but contempt for irrelevant, poorly conceived abstraction which he would dismiss as “aerodynamics in a viscous fluid".</p>
<p>As a science organizer (and a thinker on organization of science), Mahalanobis was one of the very best of our time. The fact that Indian contributions to Statistics have been so noteworthy is due to him, more than to anything else. In spite of being close to India's first prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and many other national leaders, Mahalanobis was never a part of any establishment. He disliked all forms of bureaucracy in Indian science. He was an organizer with vision who loved innovation and adventure and was ready to take risks. He was an entrepreneur in science.<br />

<p><b>Jarl Waldemar LINDEBERG</b><br />
b. 4 August 1876 - d. 24 December 1932<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Finnish mathematician and statistician, Lindeberg is best known for his important proof of the central limit theorem.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg was son of a teacher at the Helsinki Polytechnical Institute; the family was well-to-do. He was aware early of his mathematical talent and interest. Having taken his candidate's degree in 1897, he went for a year to study in Paris, with the support of an aunt. Provided from there with a theme - apparently essentially his own choice - for his doctoral dissertation, on partial differential equations, he went for the following winter with his family to Corfu, sharing his time between scientific and social occupations. In December 1900 he was ready to defend his thesis, with Ernst Linde1öf as the appreciative opponent. In spring 1902 he was appointed docent and three years later adjunct of Mathematics. In 1919 he was awarded the title of professor. Being economically independent, and feeling the position of adjunct best to his taste, he never cared for an ordinary chair. Apart from his teaching at the university he also taught at the Technical University 1911-18, and in his younger days in a Finnish secondary school. Among his pupils he found his future wife, Inez Beeker, whom he married in 1905, barely a year after her graduation.</p>
<p>Lindeberg remained interested in the problems of school teaching, and represented Mathematics in the Matriculation Examination Board from 1902 to 1918. The problems that he gave were expressly aimed at testing not only knowledge but also the ability to think; afterwards, he often had to defend them against enraged school teachers. What was wrong, according to him, was not the examination in itself, but rather the widespread tendency to require this examination for professions that had nothing to do with true academic studies.</p>
<p>He was elected member of the Society of Sciences in 1909 and of the Finnish Academy of Sciences in 1919. In the latter he acted for many years as treasurer.</p>
<p>Lindeberg's scientific activity comprises several different periods. Having started out with partial differential equations, he shifted to the calculus of variations, which occupied him from about 1904 to 1915. Around 1918, there is a short interlude given to the theory of functions. His later years, until his early death in 1932, were devoted to the fields in which he was to become most renowned, viz., probability and statistics. A first impulse in this direction he probably received when he was appointed to the administrative board of a short-lived life insurance company in 1912; his main achievment was actually its sound liquidation. He was later an active member of the Finnish Actuarial Society. From 1916 he regularly lectured on probability, and was soon considered a national expert in that field; in 1925, his adjunctship was redefined so as to cover, in particular, the calculus of probability and its applications. At about the same time representatives of several scientific associations requested him to write an elementary text-book on the subject, and in 1927 he published his <i>Todennakoisyyslasku</i> (Calculus of Probability with Applications to Statistics) which presupposes no calculus. The ultimate objective is to provide research workers in various fields with tools for critical judgement.</p>
<p>Lindeberg's scientific profile is that of an independent and critical research worker, a man who is able to distinguish between essentials and unessentials, and feels an urge to get to the bottom of problems. These qualities were of particular importance in his dealing with probability and statistics - fields on the border line between pure and applied Mathematics, and fields in which the fundamental notions were at that time just about to crystallize. For instance, in choosing descriptive characteristics for distributions, Lindeberg, with typical common sense, first of all wanted them to give easily understandable answers to simple questions.</p>
<p>In his thinking habits, he seems to have been a lone wolf; he worked best when alone at his desk, trying to find out things for himself rather than consulting predecessors. According to Lindelöf, Lindeberg always found it laborious to study other people's writings. He spoke with much modesty and joking irony of his own relationship to science. “You see", he once said, “owning a country place with forest and farming land, in Helsinki I can defend my laziness by saying that I am really a farmer, and in the country by claiming really to be a scientist". In his earlier years, he had serious doubts about his ability.</p>
<p>As an academic teacher, Lindeberg was painstaking and helpful but somewhat dry. In private life he was a friendly and sociable person, with wide interests, and a large circle of relatives and friends among whom he was much loved.</p>
<p>Lindeberg's first and most famous contribution to probability and statistics was his new proof of the <i>central limit theorem</i>. That is, roughly speaking, the sum of a large number of independent random variables is approximately normally distributed. A proposition to this effect was first formulated by Laplace in 1812. The first rigorous proof of it was given by Ljapunov in 1901. The conditions imposed in his proof are fairly wide, but it suffers from the drawback that it requires the existence of the third absolute moments of the component distributions. When Lindeberg first attacked the problem he was not aware of Ljapunov's proof, only of a much weaker result by von Mises (q.v.). His first paper on the matter, <i>Über das Exponentialgesetz in der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung</i> (Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn., 1920) essentially leads up to Ljapunov's results, but uses entirely different methods. Whereas Liapunov had used the characteristic function, Lindeberg's proof, although rather intricate, is in principle elementary: using the ordinary convolution formula, he step by step compares the distributions of the cumulative sums of (a) the arbitrary random variables under consideration, to those of (b) normal variables with the same variances as in (a). An ingenious device is to start off both series with an auxiliary normal term. Two years later, having learnt about Ljapunov's proof, Lindeberg modified and improved his own, in <i>Eine neue Herleitung des Exponentialgesetzes in der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung</i> (Math. Zeitschr., 1922). His ultimate result, which goes beyond Liapunov's, can in a slightly modified version be formulated as follows: Let <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ X_1,X_2,...$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img1.png" title="$ X_1,X_2,...$" width="83" /></span> be independent random variables with means 0, with variances <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {\sigma_i}^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img2.png" title="$ {\sigma_i}^2$" width="28" /></span> , and with cumulative distribution functions <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {F_i}(x), i= 1,2,..$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img3.png" title="$ {F_i}(x), i= 1,2,..$" width="133" /></span> . Let <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {s_n}^2 = {\sigma_1}^2 + ... + {\sigma_n}^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img4.png" title="$ {s_n}^2 = {\sigma_1}^2 + ... + {\sigma_n}^2$" width="170" /></span> be the variance of the sum <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ S_n = X_1+X_2+... +X_n$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img5.png" title="$ S_n = X_1+X_2+... +X_n$" width="206" /></span> . Then a <i>sufficient</i> condition for the c.d.f. of <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ S_n/s_n$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img6.png" title="$ S_n/s_n$" width="52" /></span> approaching uniformly the normed c.d.f. with mean 0 and variance 1, is that the "normed tail sum" of the variances tends to zero, i.e. that the following condition (L) holds:</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle {s_n}^{-2} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \int_{\vert x\vert &gt; t s_n} x^2 dF_i (x) \rightarrow 0$" border="0" height="70" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img7.png" title="$\displaystyle {s_n}^{-2} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \int_{\vert x\vert &gt; t s_n} x^2 dF_i (x) \rightarrow 0$" width="244" /></div>
as <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n \rightarrow \infty$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img8.png" title="$ n \rightarrow \infty$" width="65" /></span> for each <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ t &gt; 0$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img9.png" title="$ t &gt; 0$" width="46" /></span> . In 1935, Feller proved that the criterion is, in a sense, the sharpest possible under the plausible restriction to situations in which <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ s_n \rightarrow \infty$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img10.png" title="$ s_n \rightarrow \infty$" width="71" /></span> , <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {\sigma_n}/s_n \rightarrow 0$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img11.png" title="$ {\sigma_n}/s_n \rightarrow 0$" width="90" /></span> the <i>Lindeberg condition</i> (L) is actually <i>necessary</i>.
<p>Once Lindeberg had become known as an expert on probability, he was approached as consultant in various fields of application: biology, medicine, linguistics, and above all, forestry. He was thus led to an active interest in mathematical statistics, a branch of science which at that time went through a most dynamic evolution, launched by the British statisticians K. Pearson (q.v.) and R. A. Fisher (q.v.). In far-away Finland, the impact of this development was hardly yet to be noted. While one of the main objectives of the British school was the derivation of exact distributions (like the <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \chi^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img12.png" title="$ \chi^2$" width="24" /></span> , <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img13.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> , and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ F$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img14.png" title="$ F$" width="19" /></span> laws) for sample statistics connected with normal distributions, Lindeberg essentially stuck to the classical “large sample" technique, i.e., the approximate calculation of mean errors on which statistical inference could be based if there was enough material to warrant normality. With his characteristic urge for common sense in the applications, Lindeberg was particularly interested in the choice of sensible statistics to describe relevant properties of the sampled population; that is, statistics that gave simple answers to simple questions and were intuitively explainable to laymen.</p>
<p>In a paper read at the Scandinavian Congress in Copenhagen, <i>Uber die Korrelation</i> (1925), Lindeberg objects to Pearson's correlation coefficient which “does not answer any natural question", instead, he supports an association statistic called “percentage of correlation", proposed by Esscher and equivalent to what has later been called <i>Kendall's tau</i>; its mean error is announced, and in a later publication derived. Several of his papers are actually early contributions, probably not much noted, to the theory of <i>non-parametric methods</i> in statistics.</p>
<p>Lindeberg, also became interested in linear multivariate analysis. His paper <i>Zur Korrelationstheorie</i> (1929) is concerned with partial regression and correlation coefficients, and notably with the mean errors of the corresponding sample statistics; in a subsequent paper there is a more streamlined treatment of the same subject.</p>
<p>The only consultation work of Lindeberg that led to publications was his dealing with forestry but here his contributions were of lasting importance. They are published in two small papers, <i>Über die Berechnung des Mittelfehlers des Resultates einer Linientaxierting</i> (1924) and Z<i>ur Theoria der Linientaxierung</i> (1926), both in <i>Acta Forestalia Fennica</i>. They are concerned with line transect sampling procedures for estimating such quantities as (say) the lumber volume <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/63/l2h/img15.png" title="$ p$" width="14" /></span> per hectare, taken in the mean over a large area. In the second of the papers, it is interesting to note an attempt at small sample theory: Lindeberg actually derives Student's distribution, presumably wholly unaware of the achievements of the contemporary British school.<br />

<p><b>Adolphe QUETELET</b><br />
b. 22 February 1796 - d. 17 February 1874<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Active in many area of science, notably mathematics, astronomy and meteorology, Adolphe Quetelet owes his celebrity to the international blossoming under his impetus of the study of populations, emanating from sophisticated statistics organized systematically and treated probabilistically.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Lambert-Adolphe-Jacques Quetelet, who became known mainly under the first name of Adolphe, was the fifth in a large family of nine children, not all of whom survived to adulthood. He was born in Ghent, where his father François Quetelet, a Frenchman from Picardy, had established himself 10 years earlier, and in 1790 had married Anne-Françoise Van de Velde, a Walloon from the south of Brabant. He grew up close to his father, who was involved as a municipal officer in the political activities of the city of Ghent.</p>
<p>In the course of his studies at the Ghent Lycée, Adolphe appears to have adapted himself to the upheavals of the educational system without serious problems. This was the period of transition from the Austrian educational structure current under the Empress Maria Theresia, which prevailed in the Austrian Netherlands until 1790, to the French republican organization and its immediate imperial successor. His father's death in 1803, while not preventing him from completing his secondary studies brilliantly, placed his family in financial difficulties. To cope with these, on leaving the Lycee in 1813, he immediately took up teaching duties, and after the fall of Napoleon was appointed mathematics teacher at the Ghent municipal college, which had replaced the imperial Lycée. When the University of Ghent was founded in 1817, he took the opportunity of enrolling in the new institution's Faculty of Sciences. He was awarded his Doctorate of Science 2 years later for a thesis in Latin on a geometrical topic, through which his name became associated with the concept of a focal curve.</p>
<p>In an era marked by great changes in the political structures within Europe, Quetelet was on the look-out for any avenue which would allow him to progress in his career. In October 1819, he was appointed professor at a scholarly institution in Brussels, and elected to the Academy of this city. He had impressed its members not only by the value of the results in his doctoral thesis, but also by his human qualities: this young mathematician also exhibited a taste for art and poetry, literature and languages. He also felt an immense urge to participate in the development of Brussels, the city in which he was to live until the end of his days.</p>
<p>His growing renown was to put him in touch with the then Minister for Public Education; this was in 1823, when Brussels had once again become a city of the southern Netherlands. The Minister had lent his support to a project which Quetelet championed vigorously: the creation of a city observatory, to develop scientific activities related to astronomy. Quetelet argued the case so convincingly that he was sent to Paris to learn the practice of astronomy, and prepare plans for the construction and equipment of the observatory.</p>
<p>His sojourn in the French capital proved to be most rewarding. Alexis Bouvard, the director of the Paris observatory, benevolently took him under his wing. Quetelet enthusiastically acquired all that he needed to carry out his project. He returned to Brussels with physics instruments but even more importantly, and beyond his astronomical mission, his meetings with Lacroix, Poisson (q.v.) and Fourier and his contacts with Laplace (q.v.) had convinced him of the essential role of probability theory.</p>
<p>In Brussels again, he immersed himself in the construction of the observatory . For almost 4 years, he travelled to various countries visiting the main observatories of the time, and acquiring instruments. But during this period, he also popularized in Belgium the knowledge he had gained during his stay in Paris. He organized public lectures in experimental physics and astronomy at the Brussels Museum, where they proved enormously successful. He wrote popular works on science, publishing <i>Astronomie élémentaire</i> in 1826, followed by <i>Astronomie populaire</i> and <i>Positions de physique</i> in 1827, and <i>Instructions populaires sur le calcul des probabilités</i> in 1828. In addition, he founded a periodical review <i>Correspondance mathématique et physique</i> together with Garnier, his thesis director; this was to enable him to communicate his mathematical papers to a wide audience, and so establish close collaboration with numerous foreign colleagues. He also ventured into the field of applied statistics with his paper on the laws of births and mortality in Brussels, published in 1826, and similar research led him to demand a complete population census, decreed in 1828. Eventually, as President of the Commission Centrale de Statistique of Belgium, he was to take an active part in the census of 1846.</p>
<p>The year 1828 was a turning point in Quetelet's life: he was appointed astronomer of the Brussels Observatory (which was to be inaugurated only 4 years later), and decided to redouble his efforts to complete its construction. He gave up his professorial duties, and travelled to foreign observatories: he happened to be in Italy when he learned the news of the Belgian Revolution in September 1830. The government of the new state of Belgium rapidly confirmed him in the post of director of “his" observatory. He was to live with his new nationality during the next 25 years of splendid achievement, as much in his intellectual and scientific activities as in his involvement in the public life of his country.</p>
<p>In 1834, he was elected Perpetual Secretary of the Académie des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Bruxelles, which was to become the Royal Academy of Belgium in 1845; he held this position until his death. Within this august institution he played an essential role as indefatigable organizer of its activities and publications. The yearbooks and bulletins of the Academy, in particular, were to prove important media for the diffusion of his works, as well as those of his colleagues.</p>
<p>In 1836, he had the opportunity of emphasizing once again his interest in the calculus of probabilities. The occasion was his tutoring of princes Ernest and Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the latter to become the future consort of Queen Victoria of Great Britain. Albert was very impressed by Quetelet, and later played an important role in fostering his relations with British scientists. The lessons which Quetelet gave are the basis of an important work in his opus, published in 1846 under the title <i>Lettres à S.A.R. le Duc régnant de Saxe-Cobourg et Gotha, sur la théorie des probabilités appliquées aux sciences morales et politiques.</i> The epistolary form of this work highlights the pedagogical qualities of the author, but its specific importance lies in Quetelet's developing concern to apply the fundamental rules of probability theory in the study of human populations. This problem had interested Quetelet since 1825 and was to continue into the 1830's. In 1835, he decided to consolidate his oeuvre by publishing a book entitled <i>Sur l'homme et le développement de ses facultés,</i> adding the subtitle <i>Essai de physique sociale</i> which was to give rise to many controversies. Many of the reactions to the book concerned Quetelet's concept of <i>l'homme moyen</i>( the average man), and the question whether Quetelet's theories were deterministic or not. The literary rather than technical form of Quetelet's expository style was prone to many misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Quetelet's continuing activity in diverse areas of research is illustrated by two later works: <i>Du système social et des lois qui le régissent</i>, and <i>Sur le climat de la Belgique</i> published respectively in 1848 and 1849. In Brussels in 1853, he also organized and presided over the International Maritime Conference, whose brief was to establish a uniform system for meteorological observations, as well as over the First International Congress of Statistics, which was to be followed periodically by similar meetings in other cities. The principle of such meetings was to be emulated when the International Statistical Institute was created.</p>
<p>His brilliant career was affected by a stroke in 1855. For nearly the next 20 years, he devoted himself mainly to the republication or issue of supplemented editions of his earlier works. He was able to indulge his interest in the history of science; this took the form of publishing, particularly in the yearbooks of the Belgian Academy, various biographical notices; and also producing two books on the history of mathematics and physics in Belgium ( 1864 and 1867). He continued to attend the International Congresses of Statistics, where he was always an prominent participant.</p>
<p>The diversity of his foci of interest may help to explain the occasionally superficial nature of his works. He was an enthusiast and polymath rather than a deep theoretician. A visit to England in the 1830's when he met Babbage and Malthus (q.v.) amongst others, had been influential in the eventual formation of the Statistical Society of London, later to become the Royal Statistical Society. His numerous contacts and warm personality led him on more than one occasion to defend or favour the career of an individual whose merits he had recognized. This was particularly the case for the mathematicians Dandelin and Pagani, and for his disciple and future biographer Mailly. One might aver that Quetelet in the smaller Belgium played a role in the recruitment of scientists similar to that of Alexander von Humboldt in Germany. The family archives have a letter in which Humboldt recommends a young German scholar to Quetelet; this was Theodore Schwann, the founder of cellular theory, who was to pursue a brilliant career in Belgium.</p>
<p>As a result of Quetelet's activities, a gigantic network of sources of his correspondence exists, of which there is still no complete inventory. It includes correspondence with many of various scientists of his day, such as the leading French statistician Bienaymé (q.v.), and the mathematician Catalan who eventually made a career in Belgium. Thus it was that Quetelet died on the night between the 16th to the 17th of February 1874, having continued his work in the interests of science till the very end.<br />

<p><b>Wilhelm LEXIS</b><br />
b. 17 July 1837 - d. 24 August 1914<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> In a hostile germanic environment Lexis established statistics as a highly mathematical subject based on the probability calculus, by means of his dispersion theory.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Wilhelm Lexis, the son of a physician, was born in Eschweiler near Aachen, in Germany. He studied at the University of Bonn from 1855, first devoting himself to law, and later to mathematics and the natural sciences. He was awarded his doctorate in philosophy in 1859 for a thesis on analytical mechanics. For some time, he taught secondary school mathematics at the Bonn Gymnasium. He also held a job in the Bunsen chemical laboratory in Heidelberg.</p>
<p>Lexis' departure for Paris in 1861 marked a turning point in his career. It was there that he developed his interest in the social sciences and political economy, as well as familiarizing himself with the works of Quetelet (q.v.). His first major work, published in Bonn in 1870, was a detailed study of the evolution of France's foreign trade after the restoration of the monarchy (<i>Die Ausfuhrprämien im Zusammenhang mit der Tarifgeschichte und Handelsentwicklung Frankreichs seit der Restauration</i>). In it Lexis stressed the importance of basing economic theories on quantitative data, while not hesitating to make use of mathematics.</p>
<p>The Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 forced him to return to Germany. While editing the <i>Amtliche Nachrichten für Elass-Lothringen</i> at Hagenau, then the seat of the general government of Alsace-Lorraine, he befriended Friedrich Althof, who was to become director of higher education in the Prussian Ministry of Education and Culture. This friendship was at the basis of Lexis' active participation in the exchange of ideas and reforms of German universities.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1872, he was very appropriately appointed as professor extraordinarius (Associate Professor) in political economy at the newly created University of Strasbourg, then one semester old, where Althof was also teaching. It was in the same year that he took part in the formation of the Verein für Sozialpolitik, a movement of university members (the Kathedersozialisten), an offshoot of the historical school whose aim was the promotion of social politics. It was in the Alsatian capital that he wrote his impressive introduction to the theory of statistical demography, <i>Einleitung in die Theorie der Bevölkerungsstatistik</i>, published in 1875.</p>
<p>By then he had already left Strasbourg for Dorpat, but not without recognition by award of Doctor rerum politicorum honoris causa in 1874. In Dorpat (now Tartu in Estonia), a town in the Russian Empire where the language of university instruction was German till 1895, he held the Chair as full professor in Geography, Ethnography and Statistics. He spent only two years there, returning to the banks of the Rhine as Chair of Political Economy at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau from 1876 to 1884. This was undoubtedly his most productive period. His publications of the time, most of them appearing in <i>Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik</i>, of which he was chief editor beginning from 1891, propelled him to the front rank in the field of theoretical statistics, and revealed him as the leader of a group working on the application of the calculus of probabilities to statistical data.</p>
<p>Lexis simultaneously continued his research in political economy, editing the first German encyclopedia of economic and social sciences <i>Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften</i>. He was particularly expert in the field of finance, publishing his <i>Erörterungen über die Währungsfragen</i>, among other works in 1881.</p>
<p>In 1884, he resigned his Chair in Freiburg for the Chair of Statistics (<i>Staatswissenschaften</i>) at the University of Breslau (now Wroclaw in Poland). Finally, in 1887, he moved to Göttingen where he held the Chair of Statistics until his death, a few days after the start of the First World War. Bortkiewicz (q.v.) was his student in Göttingen in 1892. In 1895, Lexis founded the first actuarial institute in Germany (<i>Königliches Seminar für Versicherungswissenschaften</i>), which trained its candidates in both political economy and mathematics. His scholarship in both fields allowed him to manage its direction, and to provide part of the teaching in economics and statistics, while G. Bohlmann took charge of the teaching of mathematics.</p>
<p>Lexis left his mark on the history of statistics through his pioneering work on dispersion, which led on to the analysis of variance. Lexis' plan was to measure and compare the fluctuations for different statistical time series. In a sense, he followed Quetelet in applying urn models to statistical series. But by stressing fluctuations, he corrected Quetelet's work, which aimed to set every series within a unique “normal" model by assuming quite erroneously their homogeneity and stability. Similarly, using a binomial urn model to represent the annual number of male births, he derived a dispersion coefficient <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ Q$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/62/l2h/img1.png" title="$ Q$" width="20" /></span> (in homage to Quetelet) which is the ratio of the empirical variance of the series considered to the assumed theoretical variance. An analogous coefficient of divergence had been independently constructed by the French actuary Emile Dormoy in 1874. In the ideal case, Lexis refers to a “normal" dispersion when the fluctuations are purely due to chance, and the coefficient is equal to 1. But in most cases the coefficient is different from 1, and thus differs from the binomial model. The fluctuations then indicate a “physical" rather than a chance component. Lexis classified these dispersions into two categories, “hypernormal" and “hyponormal" according as to whether <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ Q &gt; 1$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/62/l2h/img2.png" title="$ Q &gt; 1$" width="54" /></span> or <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ Q &lt; 1$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/62/l2h/img3.png" title="$ Q &lt; 1$" width="54" /></span> . He also showed that series of social data usually have a hypernormal dispersion.</p>
<p>His studies on the ratio of sexes at birth, his stability theory of statistical series with his famous <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ Q$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/62/l2h/img4.png" title="$ Q$" width="20" /></span> coefficient of dispersion were re-examined in his large treatise entitled <i>Abhandlungen zur Theorie der Bevölkerungs- und Moralstatistik</i>(1903). In a review of it, Bortkiewicz in 1904 concludes that “(Lexis) has known how to clarify and synthesize the most general problems of moral and demographic statistics, insofar as their conditions, methods and tasks are concerned; he has also shown that if this science has had to renounce its status as “social physics" to which Quetelet tried to raise it, it remains nevertheless far more than the simple social accounting which some modern, and excessively timid, practitioners of the discipline would have us believe."</p>
<p>Lexis' coefficient foreshadowed the statistics of K.Pearson (q.v.) and R.A. Fisher (q.v.), in particular <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {\chi}^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/62/l2h/img5.png" title="$ {\chi}^2$" width="24" /></span> for the analysis of variance. However, it suffered from certain weaknesses which his more mathematical and younger contemporaries did not fail to point out and attempt to correct, among them Chuprov (q.v.), Markov (q.v.) and Bortkiewicz. In publications up to the period between the two World Wars, the Continental School of mathematical statistics tended to follow the dispersion theory of Lexis, but both eventually gave way together to the Anglo-Saxon developments in this area. Lexis' statistical views, however, did not disappear from view as they had the dubious distinction of being singled out for attack on their reactionary and bourgeois nature within the Soviet Union, by guardians of ideology such as Yastremsky.<br />

<p><b>Stuart Arthur RICE</b><br />
b. 21 November 1889 - d. 4 June 1969<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Rice, American sociologist and statistician, set up and headed the Office of Statistical Standards in the then U.S. Bureau of the Budget in the 1930s.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Stuart A. Rice was born in Minnesota and attended the University of Washington (BA, 1912; MA, 1915). After graduating from college he was active in local politics in Washington state, and worked for the Washington State Industrial Welfare Commission and the New York City Department of Public Charities. He received his PhD training in Sociology (1924) at Columbia University under Franklin Giddings, and taught at Dartmouth College (1923-26) and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School from 1926 to 1933. He was Research Secretary for Social Statistics for the Social Science Research Council in 1931-32 and was a visiting professor of Sociology at the University of Chicago in 1932-33. His major work during the period was in the area of voting studies and survey research methods. He published <i>Quantitative Methods in Politics</i> in 1928, was a major contributor to the President's Commission on Recent Social Trends, edited several important collections of essays for the Social Science Research Council on innovations in research methods, particularly <i>Methods in Social Science: A Case Book</i> (1931), and in 1933 was elected President of the American Statistical Association.</p>
<p>In his academic work, Rice was especially concerned with improving the methodology of social science, in particular in the study of politics. As he noted in his first chapter in <i>Quantitative Methods in Politics</i> (p. 5), when he began his study, there was “no present book known to the writer dealing with political statistics as a separate groups of applications of statistical principles," His “aim" therefore was “to demonstrate in some parts of the political field the possibilities of obtaining by quantitative procedure more exact statements of situation or relationship than have hitherto been secured." Clearly drawing his inspiration to the breakthroughs in inferential statistics of his day, he baldly stated his “point of view" as “determinstic, inductive, and to a considerable extent experimental." The later developments in political science have borne out his initial goals.</p>
<p>In the early 1930s Rice was drawn into the new administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He became Assistant Director of the Bureau of the Census in 1933, and from that point until the 1950s, his major contributions to statistics were in the realm of modernizing government statistical practice. He fostered the development of COGSIS (Committee on Government Statistics and Information Services) and served as its Acting Chairman, and worked to bring modern techniques of survey sampling and mathematical statistics to federal agencies. In 1936 he moved from the Census Bureau to chair the newly created Central Statistical Board, an agency which had been recommended by COGSIS. In 1940 the Central Statistical Board was restructured as the Division (later Office) of Statistical Standards in the Bureau of the Budget (now Office of Management and Budget) and Rice became the Assistant Director for Statistical Standards in the Budget Bureau. In these capacities he created the forms clearance procedures and built the oversight office that became the hallmark of federal statistical planning. During the Second World War, while Director of Statistical Standards, he fostered the development of the Inter-American Statistical Institute. He helped establish the Statistical Office of the United Nations and served as the first Chairman of the UN Statistical Commission. He made major efforts to improve the statistical services of countries around the world, particularly Japan and Korea. He remained in his post at the Bureau of the Budget until he was forced into mandatory retirement in 1955. He went on the found Stuart A. Rice Associates (later Surveys &amp; Research Corporation), a statistical consulting firm with contracts with government and private profit and nonprofit agencies around the world. Rice retired once again in the mid 1960s and died in 1969.<br />

<p><b>Pierre-Simon Marquis de LAPLACE</b><br />
b. 23 March 1749 - d. 5 March 1827<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Pierre-Simon Laplace was the most prominent exponent of 19th century probability theory. His major probabilistic work, the <i class="slanted">Théorie analytique des probabilités</i> considerably influenced the development of mathematical probability and statistics right to the beginning of the 20th century.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Pierre-Simon Laplace was born in Beaumont-en-Auge (Normandy). His parents, Pierre and Marie-Anne, née Sochon, lived in comfortable bourgeouis circumstances. Laplace's scientific career evolved in a period of political upheaval, but it continued to flourish in all political systems (1789 French Revolution, 1799 Napoleon's seizure of power, 1815 reestablishment of the monarchy). Originally destinated to become a priest, Laplace soon discovered his mathematical talents. Supported by d'Alembert (q.v.), he obtained a professorship at the <i>École Militaire</i> in 1771. In 1773 he was admitted to the <i>Académie des Sciences de Paris</i> of which he became one of the leading members in the 1780's. After the revolution, Laplace played a decisive role in the commission of weights and measures aiming at the introduction of the metric system. Around 1795 he became very influential in the organization and teaching of the newly established <i>École Polytechnique</i> and <i>École Normale</i>. Laplace served only 6 weeks as Napoleon's unfortunate Minister of the Interior in 1799, thereafter he was honorably transferred to the Senate of which he became Chancellor in 1803. Louis XVIII, too, had the highest esteem for Laplace. In 1816 he was admitted to the <i>Académie Française</i> and in 1817 he was raised to the rank of a Marquis. Laplace died on 5 March 1827 in Paris, having pursued his scientific research very actively almost to the end of his life.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Scientific Work in General</b></p>
<p>Laplace contributed numerous articles to optics, acoustics, heat and capillarity. In his purely mathematical papers, he dealt mainly with difference and differential equations. The focal points of Laplace's scientific activities were theoretical astronomy and probability theory, which contained, according to Laplace's approach, also those parts today considered as “statistics". From Laplace's point of view, a differentiation between “probability theory" and “statistics" would not have been appropriate. In 1796 the popular <i>Exposition du système du monde</i> appeared and between 1799 and 1805 the first 4 volumes of the <i>Traité de mécanique céleste</i>, the fifth volume of which was published by Laplace in 1825 ((<i>Œuvres I-V</i>). In his work on physics and astronomy, which made him the leading figure within French natural sciences, Laplace became the most prominent propagator of the idea that, in principle, each condition in the world could, according to the pattern of determining position and velocity of celestial bodies, be precalculated. Laplace put this strictly deterministic point of view in concrete form by his proverbial “Laplacean demon". The <i>Théorie analytique des probabilités</i> (Ist ed. 1812, 2nd ed. 1814, with an extensive introduction and a chapter on the probability of testimonies, 3rd ed. 1820 with supplements = (Œuvres VII) was the sum of Laplace's probabilistic work since 1774. The introduction which was added to the <i>Théorie analytique</i> from the 2nd ed. was also published separately between 1814 and 1825 in 5 editions under the title <i>Essai philosophique sur les probabilités</i>.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Philosophy of Probability</b></p>
<p>Laplace held the view that man, in contrast to the “demon", was capable of achieving only partial knowledge about the causes and laws which regulate the processes of the cosmos, but he maintained that probability theory was a means to overcome this defiency. In accordance with this concept, Laplace put special emphasis on subjective probabilities depending on the degree of information, but the frequentistic notion of probability is also used in Laplace's work in many places. Laplace was convinced of the universal applicability of probability calculus and he summarized this opinion, which he shared with all probabilists of the enlightenment, by the words: “Probability is basically good sense, reduced to a calculus."<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Analytic Methods of Probability Theory</b></p>
<p>Laplace considered his form of probability theory, as described in the <i>Théorie analytique</i>, important not only because of its universal applicability but also because of its innovative analytical methods. Actually, no probabilist before Laplace was able to offer results which could have been compared with the analytical content of the ones presented by Laplace. Consequently, the <i>Théorie analytique</i> was divided into two books, the first dealing exclusively with the analytical apparatus, in particular with the application of generating functions to difference equations and techniques for calculating and approximating definite integrals. Laplace already used, albeit in a still rudimentary form, characteristic functions for the representation of the probabilities of sums of independent random variables. In its emphasis on the analytical importance of probabilistic problems, especially in the context of the “approximation of formula functions of large numbers," Laplace's work goes beyond the contemporary view which almost exclusively considered aspects of practical applicability.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Bayesian Methods and Population Statistics</b></p>
<p>A considerable part of Laplace's contributions, which would be considered today as belonging to “mathematical statistics", was based on inverse probabilities. By this method, the a posteriori probability of a certain hypothesis could be calculated from the results of random experiments, usually under the tacit assumption of an a priori equiprobability of all possible hypotheses. We are not sure about whether Laplace began his inquiries with or without a knowledge of Bayes' (q.v.) fundamental treatise (1764) on this issue. By the aid of suitable approximations to his resultant formulas - a problem which Bayes had failed to solve - Laplace showed in several papers, published between 1774 and 1786, that, on the basis of the existing data, the probability of a boy's birth is, almost infallibly, greater than 1/2; that the birth rate for boys in London is in all likelihood greater than in Paris, and so on. One can suppose that reports on death rates in French hospitals, published by the <i>Académie des Sciences</i>, were also based on similar Laplacian calculations. Together with Condorcet (q.v.) and Séjour, Laplace was a member of the commission of the <i>Académie des Sciences</i> which organized, in the 1780's, the publication of several papers concerning population statistics in all parts of France, based chiefly on data sampled by La Michodiére. In these statistical investigations the idea of a micro census, as already used by Graunt (q.v.) was pursued: The ratio between the number of persons and the number of births per year within a suitable selection of population must be approximately equal to the ratio between the total number of persons and the total number of births per year. By a Bayesian approach, Laplace calculated the probability of the deviation of the estimated value for the total number of persons from its actual value, if the estimation was obtained by equating both ratios. Between 1799 and 1802 a micro census was organized for the whole of France according to “Laplace's method" ((<i>Œuvres</i> VII, 398-401). Laplace's interest in population statistics, however, was apparently less motivated by social or political concerns, than by the scientific aim of making evident that the social world can basically be approached by the same probabilistic methods as the physical.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Central Limit Theorem, Asymptotic Error Theory</b></p>
<p>Laplace's main probabilistic result was a fairly general central limit theorem, which was obtained around 1810. This theorem assures an approximate normal distribution for practically all sums of independent random variables in nature and society, if only the number of the summands is large. This result, although it was nowhere explicitely formulated, but in each case deduced in the context of its special applications, was to become a leitmotif of Laplace's <i>Théorie analytique</i>. On the basis of approximate normal distributions of linear combinations of errors of observation, Laplace succeeded in showing that the method of least squares is, according to various criteria, asymptotically “most advantageous" for estimating the parameters of linear models which occur in the context of astronomical or geodetic observations. Thus, he presented basic ideas of asymptotic statistics within the scope of error theory. Error calculus also served Laplace as a pattern for the determination of natural regularities hidden by irregular fluctuations, such as weather conditions. An important example was the “constant" difference of the air pressures in the morning and in the afternoon. For an assessment of whether assumed regularities actually existed, Laplace's central limit theorem allowed a reasoning similar to the one used in modern <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a> of significance, provided that the test statistics were sums of a large number of independent random variables. On the basis of central limit theorems, Laplace arrived at a probabilistic discussion of mean errors of observation, mean gains of gambles or mean durations of life, and in this context one can find statements which today would be called weak laws of large numbers.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Probability and Moral Sciences</b></p>
<p>In continuation of the work of Condorcet, Laplace reflected on the field of erroneous human decisions, such as testimonies or verdicts, within the framework of urn models. In view of the oversimplified models Laplace expressed certain reservations, but he emphasized at the same time the advantages of probabilistic “estimations". In the first supplement of his <i>Théorie analytique</i>, Laplace calculated the a posteriori probability that the defendent is actually guilty, if <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/60/l2h/img1.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> , votes have been cast against him, under the double presupposition that among <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/60/l2h/img2.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> members of a jury the same probability <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/60/l2h/img3.png" title="$ x$" width="15" /></span> of a correct decision in the case of guilt can be assigned to all of them, and that all values <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/60/l2h/img4.png" title="$ x$" width="15" /></span> are a priority uniformly distributed between 1/2 and 1. On the basis of these calculations, Laplace gave recommendations for the composition of, and the majority within, Juries, which he also published in a pamphlet in 1816 ((<i>Œuvres</i> VII, 529f.) and repeated in a speech at the <i>Chambre des Pairs</i> (<i>Œuvres</i> XIV, 379-381) in 1821. Laplace's arguments were repeatedly brought forward in the frequent discussions of the 1820's and early 1830's about jury systems in France. At the same time, however, probabilistic reasoning within moral sciences was increasingly criticized by philosophers and mathematicians. This fell especially upon Poisson, who amplified Laplace's inquiries on moral questions by the use of a great deal of statistical data. Following Poisson (q.v.), there has been little active research in this part of classical probability theory.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Impact of Laplacian Probability</b></p>
<p>To the end of the 19th century, Laplace's <i>Théorie analytique</i> remained the most influential book of mathematical probability theory, which was considered less a part of mathematics in the narrower sense, but a discipline of “mathesis mixta". Reduced as it was by a major field of application of the classical theory, the moral sciences, and augmented only by problems which could be mastered within the framework of simple stochastic techniques, such as the kinetic theory of gases, hardly any probabilistic concepts were put forward which were new with regard to Laplace's.</p>
<p>In the field of statistics, Laplace had mainly presented theoretical concepts in a rather unsystematic way in his <i>Théorie analytique</i>. His analytical deductions were written in a very difficult style, and his mode of reasoning within error theory became far less popular in comparison with Gauss' (q.v.), which was easier to understand and to apply. The general relevance for statistics of Laplacian error theory was appreciated only by the end of the 19th century. However, it influenced the further development of a largely analytically oriented probability theory; limit distributions of sums of independent random variables became a basis of modern probability theory.</p>
<p>In addition, some basic ideas, chiefly disseminated by Laplace in a verbal form in his <i>Essai philosophique</i>, decisively influenced 19th century statistics in producing the expectancy, that all random fluctuations, in nature and society, could be treated correspondingly to the pattern of errors of observations. This concept, together with Laplace's frequent approximations by normal distributions which, however, he did not investigate as statistical objects in their own right, paved the way for the later “Quetelism".<br />

<p><b>Fedor Andreevich SHCHERBINA</b><br />
b. 13 February (o.s.) 1849 - d. 28 October 1936<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Shcherbina was the most eminent of the zemstvo statisticians in the Russian Empire; his work served as a prototype in the field, and Lenin used his data. As an émigré professor in Prague, he published a history of statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Shcherbina was born in the Cossack settlement of Novodereviankovskaia (Novodereviankivka <i>stanytsia</i>) in the Kuban' River region of the Russian Empire, the son of a priest. Such settlements (stanytsi) derived from and continued the democratic and military traditions of the Dnieper Cossacks. At age 12 he entered the military theological school in the region's capital Ekaterinodar (from 1920: Krasnodar), and in 1866 the theological seminary of the Caucasus at Stavropol'. His teachers were sympathetic to the Populist movement (intellectuals “going out among the common people"), and like his idealist generation he was influenced by the writings of N.G. Chernishevsky (1828-1889) and political economists such as John Stuart Mill, Lasalle, Becher, and especially Pfeiffer on cooperative activity. With 6 other seminarians, he left the seminary and founded the first agricultural cooperative (“collective farm") in Russia, which, however, foundered within 3 years because of lack of knowledge and experience. Seeking to deepen his knowledge, with financial support sympathetically provided by a Cossack military stipend Shcherbina entered in 1872 the Petrovsko-Rozumovsky Academy of Agriculture and Forestry in Moscow. He had to leave on account of his student political activity and moved to the Faculty of Science of the Novorossisk University in Odessa in 1874, which year saw the beginning of the destruction (1874-1877) of the Populist movement, with some 3000 of its activists sentenced to imprisonment or banishment. Among them was Shcherbina, who was sent to the Vologda <i>gubernia</i> (province) in 1876.</p>
<p>In those backward, impoverished and isolated communities, he committed himself to the socio-economic study of the common people, and the year 1879 saw the publication of the first monographic <a href="#foot45" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a> study of agriculture of any region in Russia. He was pardoned in 1800 and returned to the Kuban' region to continue in pacifist manner his populist investigation, largely of this locality.</p>
<p>The next, most stable and active, stage of Shcherbina's life began with his taking up in 1884 the directorship of the statistical department of the Voronezh <i>zemstvo</i>. The zemstvos were institutions of local government established from 1864 in the course of the great political and social reforms. Their statistical departments came to concern themselves with the rural economy of the European part of the Russian Empire. Shcherbina remained at this post for some 18 years, editing 66 volumes of statistics of the Voronezh gubernia and producing 16 separate books on related topics. For his history (1891) of the Voronezh zemstvo, he received from the Imperial Academy of Science a Tsar Aleksandr II Prize. His <i>Krest'ianskie biudzhety (Peasant budgets)</i> of 477 pages published in 1900 was a highlight of the intense statistical activity in Russia of the time, in which Shcherbina's work had served as a model for other statisticians. Its Chapter II, on budget investigation in foreign countries, reveals familiarity with developments in Western Europe, such as the work of Quetelet (q.v.), <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=26" name="menu0">Sir Frederick Morton Eden</a> (q.v.), the International Statistical Congresses and the London Statistical Society. Shcherbina is listed among the editorial staff of the <i>Bolshaia Entsiklopedia (The Great Encyclopedia)</i> published in St. Petersburg around 1900. There is a substantial entry under the title <i>Statistika</i> in volume 17, which he may have authored, which divides the statistical studies of the time into the “formal" and the “material". The first, as defined by von Mayr (q.v.), is said to be exhaustive numerical description of an entire population. (The “material" is said to be “statistical science", where causes and effects are inferred from numerical investigation.) In his later book (Shcherbyna, 1925; the transliteration of the Ukrainian form of his name is Fedir Andrievych Shcherbyna), he mentions the “new mathematical direction" of statistics based on random sampling of which the chief Russian protagonist is named as A.A. Chuprov (q.v.). Shcherbina to the end of his days, like von Mayr, remained opposed in principle to this direction.</p>
<p>In continuing sympathy with the efforts of the zemstvos and bourgeoisie to improve the lot of the peasantry and workers he wrote an influential pamphlet in 1902 on the needs of the peasant-agricultural economy, demanding amongst other things unacceptable to the then-regime, a constitutional system of government. After being questioned in early 1903 as a result he was sent into administrative banishment in the Kuban' region, under police surveillance. During this time he researched his book on the history of the Kuban' Cossack Host, and due to its widespread popularity (the work was known to Tsar Nikolai (Nicholas II)) was permitted to revive in 1906, and then head, the Cossack Council, a form of governing body, in the Kuban'. In 1904 Shcherbina was elected Corresponding Member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, and in 1907 was elected to the second Duma (Russian parliament) as a Populist Socialist. After the revolution of February 1917 the people of the Kuban' region and of Ukraine sought existence as independent republics. Shcherbina was elected to the Kuban' Legislative Council (1917-1920) and headed the supreme court of the Kuban' Cossack Host. At this time his cultural orientation began to revert to his ancestral Ukrainian. When the Bolsheviks had subjugated the Kuban' in 1920, he emigrated to Yugoslavia. During the journey across the Black Sea by ship, for his Kuban' Cossack “separatism" he was nearly thrown overboard by fleeting Russian White Guard officers.</p>
<p>During a short period in Yugoslavia he wrote a scathing attack from an economic standpoint of the 3 years Bolshevik rule in Russia (Shcherbina, 1921) which was printed in Prague to which he had moved. Here he was made full professor (1922-1936) and rector (1924-1925) at the Ukrainian Free University. He also taught statistics at the Ukrainian Husbandry Academy [Polytechnic] at Poděbrady. These institutions were distinct from the Russian College in Prague, with which A.A. Chuprov, as fellow statistical émigré from the Russian Empire, had a brief association. The years in Prague saw the publication of Shcherbina's history of statistics (Shcherbyna, 1925), remarkable for its historical scholarship and detailed insight into pre-revolutionary Russian developments.</p>
<p>The fifth edition of Lenin's collected works, Volume 3, is aware of the year of his death, but, unlike the second edition concludes with the statement “V.I. Lenin severely criticized the author's incorrect methods of analysis, which distorted reality of statistical data". However, Lenin had used Shcherbina's data extensively, and Soviet writers continued to accord him respect.</p>
<p>Shcherbina, therefore due to his eminence, longevity and immense careful producitivity figures in all three of the politically incommensurate: tsarist <i>Entsiklopedicheskii Slovar (Encyclopedic Dictionary)</i> (1904), the <i>Bolshaia Sovietskaiia Entsiklopediia (Great Soviet Encyclopedia)</i> (1957), and the émigré <i>Encyclopedia of Ukraine</i> (English version: 1993). It testifies to the universality of statistics.<br />

<p><b>Walter Andrew SHEWHART</b><br />
b. 18 March 1891 - d. 11 March 1967<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Shewhart was the father of statistical methods of quality control. His methods were closely related to an epistemology of physics and application to economics and industry in his time.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Born in Illinois, Shewhart first pursued his tertiary education at the University of Illinois, and was awarded his PhD in Physics from the University of California in 1917. He was an Assistant in Physics at the University of Illinois in 1916-17, and then became Head of the Physics Department at the Wisconsin Normal School at Lacrosse in 1917-18. In 1918, he was offered a job with the Western Electric Company, and was later transferred to the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1925; he remained in their employ until his retirement in 1956.</p>
<p>Shewhart's name is associated with methods of statistical quality control in industrial mass production (Shewhart control charts), but his contribution to the field of statistical techniques must be placed within the background of a theory of knowledge which he developed in the specific context of industrial production. Shewhart was profoundly influenced by the philosophy of pragmatism of C.S. Peirce, W. James and C.I. Lewis; this he put to work operationally in the field of engineering. At the same time, he tried to conceptualize the collective aspect of work in an enterprise; this caused him to be equally well known in the field of management, particularly thanks to W.E. Deming (q.v.) who promoted his views. Through Deming, Shewhart became well known in Japan where he consequently played an important role in the development of methods of management and quality which are associated with the name of K. Ichikawa.</p>
<p>Work on control charts originated in a political decision made by the Engineering Department management at Western Electric, which wished to define scientifically a method for ensuring “a Company-wide view" of what constituted quality assurance. Under the direction of R.L. Jones and G.D. Edwards, an entire team began to attack these problems: in addition to Shewhart, one should also mention H.F. Dodge, E.C. Molina, T.C. Fry, and H.G. Romig. When the Bell Telephone Laboratories were set up officially in 1925, engineering inspection appeared as part of their organizational chart. In 1931, Shewhart published his entire work on control charts, in a masterly treatise which still remains relevant today. The application of these statistical quality assurance methods is an achievement of which Bell Labs is still proud (Fagen, 1975).</p>
<p>Control chart methods are particularly well suited for use in workshops, as a result of their elegant usage of graphical representations, which limit the operator's need to resort to calculations. Since product quality is defined by a set of measurable physical quantities, which are assumed to follow statistical distributions, the control charts provide a relatively simple procedure for the visual representation of the evolution of the population mean and standard deviation. So far as statistical background was concerned, Shewhart first made use of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a>'s (q.v.) theory of distributions, which he complemented with the small sample theory of "Student" (Gossett, q.v.) and Fisher (q.v.). He introduced the concept of “rational subgroup" to define the method and frequency of sampling.</p>
<p>Control charts were, however, only the tip of his personal iceberg. Although he worked in industry, Shewhart remained a physicist, interested in problems of measurement in experimental physics, and in the nature of the acquisition of knowledge. He believed profoundly in the statistical nature of all physical laws, and attacked any deterministic concepts:</p>
<blockquote>We ordinarily think of the physical and engineering sciences as being exact. In a majority of physical measurements this is practically true. ... With the introduction of the molecular theory and the theory of quanta, it has been necessary to modify some of our older conceptions. Thus, more and more we are led to consider the problem of measuring any physical quantity as that of establishing its most probable value. We are led to conceive of the physico-chemical laws as a statistical determinism to which the “law of large numbers" imparts the appearance of infinite precision. (Shewhart (1913))</blockquote>
<p>To provide a theoretical foundation for the use of control charts, Shewhart, developed the concept of a “constant system of chance causes". Intuitively, the idea is simple: such a system is a random sytem governed by a statistical distribution independent of time. The control chart allows us to detect the occurrence of significant causes of perturbation (called assignable causes), which can then be tracked down and eliminated. One can thus progressively (as experience proves, according to Shewhart) eliminate all assignable causes, and the system can then be said to be “under statistical control".</p>
<p>Shewhart's theories create a bridge between the epistemology <a href="#foot43" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a> of measurement and the notion of human organization which must make the process of measurement work. Statistical control according to him consists of three phases: specification, production and inspection, corresponding respectively to making a hypothesis, carrying out an experiment and testing the hypothesis. “The three steps consitute a dynamic scientific process of acquiring scientific knowledge" (Shewhart, 1939, p. 45). These three steps were reformulated by Deming under the name “Shewhart cycle", and they arise in recent developments in the theory of organizations, such as organizational apprenticeship, of which Shewhart appears to have been a forerunner. In the same book, he writes: “mass production viewed in this way constitutes a continuing and self-corrective method for making the most efficient use of raw and fabricated material".</p>
<p>A paradox remains in the social persona of Shewhart. His works, full of references to physics and to very diverse technical areas, make difficult reading and his lectures were little understood by industrialists. On the other hand he is the inventor of quality control which has been well accepted by industry, and which is recognized as easy to use. Clearly the weight of AT&amp;T in American industry played an essential role in the promotion of his work, from the moment when the firm decided to support it. But one must also stress, his great personal ability to form alliances and weave relationships among institutional teams, which was essential to the adoption of his ideas. He played masterfully the game of recognition by agencies, learned societies and engineering associations. Already in 1929, he obtained funds to create a Joint Committee of the American Society for Testing Materials and the powerful American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This resulted in the publication in 1935 of a standard which was later adopted during the Second World War for the requirements of the military. One should also mention the promotional effects of the lectures which he delivered in London in 1932, at the invitation of Egon Pearson (q.v.). The British, who did not wish to be left behind in this area, undertook several studies which later appeared as publications of the Royal Statistical Society.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Shewhart was the recipient of many distinctions. Among these were his founding membership of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, of which he was elected Fellow in 1937 and President in 1944. He was a founding member of the American Society for Quality Control in 1947, and was their first Shewhart Medallist in 1948. He was elected to the Presidency of the American Statistical Association in 1945, and was awarded the Holley Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1954. He was a member of the International Statistical Institute from 1950, and of the Royal Statistical Society which elected him to honorary Fellowship in 1954.</p>
<p>Shewhart was nevertheless a modest and magnanimous individual, who believed in the fertility of collective work, and the value of exchanges between disciplines and professions. He saw the role of the statistician in an organization as that of the coordinator of several experts involved in the process of the production of knowledge.<br />

<p><b>Mikhailo Pylypovych KRAVCHUK (or KRAWTCHOUK)</b><br />
b. 27 September 1892 (o.s.) - d. 9 March 1942<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Kravchuk was a Professor of Mathematical Statistics in Kyiv, Ukraine. He discovered the “Krawtchouk" polynomials, and made penetrating contributions to various branches of mathematics before his arrest and death.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Kravchuk (“Krawtchouk" is a transliteration he used when writing in French) was born in the village of Chovnytsia, in the Volyn (Volhynia) region of Ukraine.</p>
<p>After secondary studies at the gymnasium at Lutsk, Kravchuk entered the Physico-Mathematical Faculty at Kyiv (Kiev) University, where in 1916 the algebraist D.O. Gravè described him as one of his most capable students. After a turbulent period on account of World War 1, the revolution and civil war, Kravchuk worked as professor in charge of mathematics and variability statistics in the Kyiv Agricultural Institute (1921-1929), in whose <i>Zapysky</i> (<i>Memoirs</i>) the Krawtchouk polynomials, a system of polynomials orthonormal with respect to the binomial distribution, make their first appearance in 1929.</p>
<p>He worked simultaneously at a number of other institutions: his first statistical publication appears in 1925 in the <i>Zapysky</i> of the Veterinary-Zootechnical Institute; and at the 1928 Bologna International Congress of Mathematicians he is listed as representing Ukraine from the National Institute of Education. In this connection especially he fostered the use of the Ukrainian language in Ukrainian mathematics, was involved in writing school texts, and in the compilation of a Ukrainian mathematical dictionary. The majority of his publications in mathematical statistics, listed and described by Movchan (1972), are in Ukrainian. An abbreviated version of the contents of the 1929 Ukrainian-language paper, without proofs, together with a summary of some additional material to appear in 1931 appeared in French (<i>C.R. Acad. Sci., Paris</i>, <b>189</b> (1929) 620-622). It is through this version and the definitive treatment of it in Szegö (1939) that Kravchuk's name in its French form was attached to the orthonormal polynomial system. This system, with the aftermath of its creation including the work of Kravchuk's students and associates (O.S. Smohorshewsky, S.M. Kulik, O.K. Lebedintseva) and overseas work, are excellently treated in English in Prizva (1992). This survey also contains a quite detailed description of the contents of a major paper in mathematical statistics of 1931 published after Kravchuk's election to the Ukrainian Academy on 29 June 1929, which has Ukrainian title “Orthogonal polynomials associated with sampling with and without replacement" and French title “Sur les polynômes orthogonaux liés avec les schémas de Bernoulli et de C. Pearson", there being a long French summary of some 9 pages. We return to it below.</p>
<p>Kravchuk was a mathematician of enormous breadth (mathematical statistics was only one of the areas in which he made significant contributions) and energy (some 180 publications in the period 1914-1938 in addition to heavy commitments in the various scientific insitutions). In addition to his work in algebra under the influence of Gravè, he passed on to functions of a real variable and other areas of analysis, differential and integral equations, and geometry as well as mathematical statistics and probability. In the period 1934-1938 he headed the Department of Mathematical Statistics of the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian Academy of Science. His work in mathematical statistics relates to the theory of correlation and regression, the bivariate normal, the method of moments in statistics, and orthogonal polynomial systems. Some of this was influenced by the work of the English Biometric School headed by <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.), as was the early work of Slutsky (q.v.), also in Kyiv in the early years of his career.</p>
<p>A theme running through much of Kravchuk's work, and not only in mathematical statistics, is the method of moments. His statistical direction was initially driven by the work of Chebyshev (q.v.) on interpolation and the method of moments, which in turn derived partly from Chebyshev's contact with the works of Bienaymé (q.v.). In the <i>Zapysky</i> version of the 1929 paper, all the substantial papers of Chebyshev on interpolation are mentioned. Kravchuk, however, uses a more modern matrix approach in contrast to Chebyshev's continued fractions. Chebyshev's work was dominant in probability and statistics in the old czarist Russian empire, and this influence of the St. Petersburg School is natural on a strong mathematician such as Kravchuk. The increasing interest in statistics itself surely derived from Kravchuk's work in institutions such as those whose <i>Zapysky</i> we have mentioned, where the need for application of statistical methods was transparent.</p>
<p>Kravchuk viewed his polynomial system as a generalization of both the Hermite polynomials (orthonormal with respect to the standard normal) and the Charlier polynomials (orthonormal with respect to the Poisson), inasmuch as both could be obtained in the limit from his. His motivation for studying them was the fact that Chebyshev's polynomials (viewed as orthonormal with respect to the uniform distribution on <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 0, 1, \cdots, n-1$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/59/l2h/img1.png" title="$ 0, 1, \cdots, n-1$" width="121" /></span> ) were a discrete analogue of the Legendre polynomials, which are obtainable in the limit. A little-noticed feature of Kravchuk's work is the expansion of a binomial probability value in terms of Krawtchouk polynomials orthonormal with respect to another binomial distribution. The germ of the idea is the analogous expansion of densities in terms of Hermite polynomials in Chebyshev's last probability paper (1887); and Kravchuk's expansion also produces the Charlier expansion of a binomial probability in the limit. More importantly, he gives a bound on the error of partial expansion, a very Chebyshevian idea. More importantly still, in his 1931 paper, he produces a polynomial system orthonormal with respect to the hypergeometric distribution. Subsequently this system, overlooked at the time outside Ukraine, even though it was described by Smohorshewsky in the very same French journal (<i>C.R. Acad. Sci., Paris</i>, <b>200</b> (1935) 801-803) has come to be credited to later work of W. Hahn. Inasmuch as the binomial distribution can be considered as a limit of the hypergeometric, this system generalizes the Krawtchouk polynomials.</p>
<p>Kravchuk was arrested on the 21 February 1938 on a number of false charges, primarily Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism and encouraging foreign espionage because of his contacts with mathematicians outside the Soviet Union, particularly with Ukrainians in Western Ukraine (specifically Levitsky and Chaikovsky, in L'viv), then a part of Poland. He died near Magadan in Siberia. Plaques in his memory have now been erected in Lutsk and in Kyiv, and a small museum established in part of the elementary school in Chovnytsia. An important and well-organized conference dedicated to his memory was held in Kyiv and Lutsk on the 50th anniversary of his death and there was a special number of the <i>Ukrainian Mathematical Journal</i> <b>44</b>, No.7, 1992. There is some biographical material about Kravchuk in Ukrainian, but little in English or Russian. For a number of years after his arrest he was officially a non-person in the Soviet Union. A general summary of his work, in English, is given by Parasyuk and Virchenko (1992). A brief sketch in English of his life and probabilistic work is given in Seneta (1993).<br />

<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b> The investigations of the physicist Smoluchowski on the theory of Brownian movement concided with those of Einstein. The work on statistical mechanics contains probably the first manifestation of a branching process with immigration, and of statistical inference for a random process.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Smoluchowski (pronounced Smo-loo-khov-ski) was born in Vorderbrühl, near Vienna to a Polish family and died in Cracow (Polish: Kraków ; German: Krakau). The times were those of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy of which the north-east part was Galicia (German: Galizien) with its university cities of Krakau (the old capital of Poland); and Lemberg (Ukrainian: L'viv; Polish: Lwów; Russian: L'vov), a city in Poland between World Wars 1 and 2, and now in Ukraine. Smoluchowski spent his youth in Vienna, where his father was a senior official of Emperor Franz Josef, and attended the Collegium Theresianium from 1880 to 1890. From 1890 to 1894 Smoluchowski studied physics at the University of Vienna under the direction of Josef Stefan and F. Exner. His studies were followed by a year of military service in the Austrian army, 1894/95, with his PhD in physics from Vienna University being conferred with the highest distinction in 1895. After some years of research in Paris in the laboratory of Gabriel Lippmann, in Glasgow under Lord Kelvin, in London, and in Berlin under Emil Warburg (this period being most significant for his future research), he worked at the University of Lemberg from 1899. Here he held the Chair of Mathematical Physics from 1903 to 1913. In 1913 he became Professor of Experimental Physics at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. He died of dysentery (doubtless due to wartime conditions) in the summer of 1917 at the age of 45 before he could take up his duties as rector of this university. His most important work was done during the period in L'vov, and is heavily probabilistic and statistical. It is regrettable, as the later Nobel laureate Chandrasekhar (1943) makes clear several times, that Smoluchowski's lucid contributions to the theory of Brownian motion, molecular fluctuations and laws of thermodynamics, have beem neglected. One might add to this list the theory of branching processes, where his contributions have long occupied a neglected position similar to that of I.J. Bienaymé (q.v.).</p>
<p>From about 1900 Smoluchowski worked on Brownian movement, and obtained a theory starting from the standpoint of examining the effects of successive collisions between a Brownian particle and successive molecules. Einstein started from general relations of statistical physics, and presented a theory of the Brownian movement in papers of 1905 and 1906. Smoluchowski had waited to use experimental data for verification of his own theory, which was little different, but in view of Einstein's first paper, published his findings in 1906. When Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, his work on Brownian motion is cited, before the discussion of the main reason for the prize : the discovery of the law of photoelectric effect.</p>
<p>Smoluchowski's theory of density fluctuations is within the context of the Brownian motion work, as the title of the 1914 paper testifies. Chandrasekhar (1943) described it as “one of the most outstanding achievements in molecular physics". Smoluchowski here modelled the fluctuation in the number of particles contained in a geometrically well-defined small element of volume, <i>v</i>, within a much larger volume of solution containing particles exhibiting random motion, the system being in equilibrium. Observations <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ X_1 , X_2 , \cdots$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img1.png" title="$ X_1 , X_2 , \cdots$" width="93" /></span> on the number of particles in <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ v$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img2.png" title="$ v$" width="14" /></span> are made at points of time at equal intervals, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \tau$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img3.png" title="$ \tau$" width="15" /></span> , apart. During such a time interval some particles present in <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ v$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img4.png" title="$ v$" width="14" /></span> at its beginning will have left it (have “died") by its end while some external to <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ v$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img5.png" title="$ v$" width="14" /></span> at the beginning of the interval may be present within <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ v$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img6.png" title="$ v$" width="14" /></span> at its end (have “immigrated"). The probability <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ P$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img7.png" title="$ P$" width="19" /></span> that a particle present at the beginning will be external at the end depends on the precise circumstances of the problem. An explicit <i>theoretical</i> solution was obtained by Smoluchowski (1914) when the motions are governed by the laws of Brownian movement, in terms of the various physical parameters. Since the system is in equilibrium, and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ v$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img8.png" title="$ v$" width="14" /></span> is small, the probability distribution describing each <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ X_n$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img9.png" title="$ X_n$" width="29" /></span> is Poisson, with mean/variance parameter <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \mu$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img10.png" title="$ \mu$" width="16" /></span> , say : <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ Pr(X_n = x) = e^{-\mu} \mu^x / x! , \ x = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img11.png" title="$ Pr(X_n = x) = e^{-\mu} \mu^x / x! , \ x = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$" width="330" /></span> . Both <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ P$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img12.png" title="$ P$" width="19" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \mu$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img13.png" title="$ \mu$" width="16" /></span> can be estimated <i>statistically</i> from the numerical observations on <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ X_1 , X_2 , \cdots$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img14.png" title="$ X_1 , X_2 , \cdots$" width="93" /></span> . A comparison of the predictions of the theory of colloid statistics with the data is therefore made possible, and was in fact carried out on the data of Th. Svedberg by Smoluchowski himself. In regard to the statistical estimation procedure, Smoluchowski derived the elegant probabilistic expression <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ E((X_{n+1} - X_{n})^2) = 2\mu \, P$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img15.png" title="$ E((X_{n+1} - X_{n})^2) = 2\mu \, P$" width="210" /></span> . Its left-hand side was estimated, using observations <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ X_1, \cdots, X_{N+1}$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img16.png" title="$ X_1, \cdots, X_{N+1}$" width="119" /></span> , naturally by</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N (X_{i+1} - X_{i})^2 / N$" border="0" height="77" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img17.png" title="$\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N (X_{i+1} - X_{i})^2 / N$" width="162" /></div>
while <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \mu$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img18.png" title="$ \mu$" width="16" /></span> was estimated by <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {\hat \mu} = \sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - {\bar X})^2 / N$" border="0" height="44" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img19.png" title="$ {\hat \mu} = \sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - {\bar X})^2 / N$" width="193" /></span> where <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {\bar X} = \sum_{i=1}^N X_i / N$" border="0" height="44" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img20.png" title="$ {\bar X} = \sum_{i=1}^N X_i / N$" width="139" /></span> , thus giving <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \hat P$" border="0" height="22" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img21.png" title="$ \hat P$" width="19" /></span> . Shortly after, it became common to use the estimator <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {\hat \mu} = {\bar X} \ $" border="0" height="39" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img22.png" title="$ {\hat \mu} = {\bar X} \ $" width="64" />&nbsp; &nbsp;for<img align="middle" alt="$ \ \mu$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img23.png" title="$ \ \mu$" width="22" /></span> (Fürth, 1918).
<p>The striking advance here on earlier fluctuation theory was the introduction of the <i>probability after-effect (“Wahrscheinlichkeitsnachwirkung") <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ P$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img24.png" title="$ P$" width="19" /></span></i> , which is a manifestation of the assumed Markovian (“given the present, the future is independent of the past") structure of the assumed model, and is of great significance in other physical contexts. Indeed the random process <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \{X_t\}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/93/l2h/img25.png" title="$ \{X_t\}$" width="45" /></span> used as a model by Smoluchowski is a Bernoulli-Poisson branching process with immigration, apparently the first time a branching process with immigration of any kind occurs in the literature. Branching processes with immigration are examples of Markov (q.v.) chains, which arose, at least as a general concept, circa 1906. This Markovian aspect of Smoluchowski's work was overlooked in German-language literature. The transition probabilities of the Bernoulli-Poisson Markov chain, which are of simple explicit kind, were however already present, both as a physical idea and in explicit form in Smoluchowski (1914).</p>
<p>It is worth reflecting on the fact that at the time of Smoluchowski's work, statistical estimation theory, even for independent samples, was in its infancy, and yet he used totally appropriate estimators in the more complex setting of a Markov chain.</p>
<p>Sommerfeld (1917) in his obituary lists 53 works by Smoluchowski over the period 1893-1917, mainly in the official language of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, German, but some in French and English; and mentions the existence of some 36 further works in Polish.</p>
<p>Smoluchowski married Zofia Baraniecka, the daughter of a mathematics professor at the Jagiellonian University, in 1901 and lived contentedly in Lemberg, taking an active part in the life of the university and the community, until the move to Cracow. He was fond of mountaineering, skiing and music in the company of his close friend Hasenörhl, who was killed in World War 1, in 1915. Smoluchowski's wife outlived him by some 40 years, and died in the U.S.A. as did his son, Roman Smoluchowski (1910 - 1996), a notable physicist. There is also family in Poland.</p>
<p>Sommerfeld(1917) refers to him as: Marian Ritter von Smolan-Smoluchowski (“Ritter" translates into “knight".)<br />

<p><b>George Handley KNIBBS</b><br />
b. 13 June 1858 - d. 30 March 1929<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> First government statistician after Federation in Australia, Knibbs contributed significantly to vital statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The Colonial Period in Australia extended from the time of European settlement in 1788 until Federation in 1901. Early vital statistics were provided in annual "Blue books" without analysis. Later, major thrusts in the development of official statistics came from the colonies of NSW, Victoria and Tasmania through the work of T.A. Coghlan, H.H. Hayter and R.M. Johnson, respectively. However, rivalry between the colonies and debate over protectionism in trade and population issues constrained progress.</p>
<p>With Federation of the colonies in 1901 the Australian Commonwealth Constitution gave the Federal Parliament authority over census and statistics. However, it was not until 1906 that the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics was created with George Handley Knibbs as its Head.</p>
<p>Knibbs, who was born in Sydney, was an unlikely appointment as the first Commonwealth Statistician; he had no background in statistics or economics and had been trained as a surveyor. He was Lecturer in Surveying at the University of Sydney from 1890 to 1903. In 1904 he was Acting Professor of Physics at the University of Sydney and in 1905 he became Director-General of Technical Education for NSW.</p>
<p>Prior to his appointment as Commonwealth Statistician Knibbs had, however, published on a wide range of topics - fluid mechanics, observational accuracy and surveying, effects of rainfall distribution on agriculture, water conservation and irrigation and city planning, albeit avoiding all considerations of randomness. These give the impression of competence as a mathematician, and a comprehensive knowledge of the international literature, but an obsessive amount of detail is sometimes provided.</p>
<p>The remainder of Knibbs' publications, some seventy in number, postdate his appointment as Commonwealth Statistician and all deal with statistical topics with the exception of two books of poetry published in 1913.</p>
<p>Knibbs interpreted his brief broadly as Commonwealth Sstaistician, to be “a professional expert in statecraft, assisting the administrative statesmen with his counsel and advice", as well as to undertake the task of unification and coordination of statistical effort, and he set to work with zeal.</p>
<p>Following a trip through Europe in 1909 to examine various statistical bureaux, and attend international congresses (including the ISI Session in Paris), Knibbs prepared a report on social insurance in which he outlined schemes operating elsewhere and made recommendations for Australia. In this work he took pains to elaborate an organic theory of the state and he justified public health measures on the grounds of national development. It should be noted that Social Darwinism, the supposed implications of evolutionary theory for social policy, was widely promoted at the time, with argument over whether the society or the individual was the developing organism. William Morris Hughes, Prime Minister during World War 1, employed evolutionary theory to justify state activity.</p>
<p>In Knibbs' work on social insurance he was led naturally to examine causes of unemployment but he suffered from lack of public co-operation both for this and for his work on the cost of living. His interest in the cost of living did lead to theoretical work on index numbers which, although well regarded in its time, was of ephemeral interest. However, it did lead to the production of the first Australian price indices based on clearly defined principles and his advocacy was important in the wide international acceptance of the fixed weights aggregative formula.</p>
<p>Knibbs' expectations were also high in terms of the possibilities for a detailed nosological classification and he maintained a continuing interest in this topic. His suggestions, which would have placed considerable demands on the medical profession, not unexpectedly achieved limited success.</p>
<p>A prime task for Knibbs upon assuming office was to commence the production of the Commonwealth <i>Year Book</i> and the first of these, which drew heavily on principles already adopted by Hayter in Victoria and Coghlan in NSW, appeared in 1908.</p>
<p>The <i>Year Books</i> were well received. Melbourne's <i>Argus</i> newspaper referred to it as “a monument to Knibbs' energy, clear-sightedness and enthusiasm" while <i>The Times</i> (of London) in a leading article described it as “The most wonderful book of its kind in the world...the creation of a genius...the Commonwealth Statistician, and there is no other publication in the Empire to compare with it." However, such praise for this kind of endeavour does not seem to have been altogether exceptional.</p>
<p>Knibbs was responsible for the first Commonwealth Census conducted in 1911 and this involved major organizational effort. The final Census Report appeared in three volumes, comprising the Statistician's Report (Volume 1) which provided a commentary on the detailed tables of results making up Volumes 2 and 3. The most notable component of Volume 1 was its Appendix A, Knibbs' “The Mathematical Theory of Population, of its Character and Fluctuations and of the Factors which Influence Them" which was subsequently printed separately (Knibbs (1917)).</p>
<p>This exhaustive treatise of 406 pages begins, after an introduction, with seven chapters devoted to methodology and then eleven further chapters giving a detailed discussion of the Australian population. In the methodological component Knibbs emphasized population distributions and the curves which represent them, and especially noteworthy is his discussion of smoothing.</p>
<p>Knibbs received almost universal praise for this treatise. Arne Fisher considered that it would “stand as one of the leading works on mathematical statistics of the twentieth century" and “it is equal to the French classics on the calculus of probability by Laplace and Poisson...". More qualified approval, however, was provided by Yule (q.v.), Elderton and R.A. Fisher (q.v.), who praised the work for its broad scope but found fault with various aspects of its theoretical content.</p>
<p>Yule and Elderton both took some exception to Knibbs fitting of his own “flexible curve" of the form <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ y=A{x}^m{exp(nx^p)}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/58/l2h/img1.png" title="$ y=A{x}^m{exp(nx^p)}$" width="150" /></span> and to his rather cursory treatment of Pearson's system of frequency curves, while R.A. Fisher noted the complete absence of any discussion of goodness of fit. Knibbs had described the Pearson curves as having a limited range of shapes available and he sought to encompass as many as possible in a singler formula. However, his procedure for fitting these curves was less than straightforward. The work was widely referenced in the population literature of the time, but principally for its encyclopaedic nature and extensive tabulations rather than for particular items of methodological content.</p>
<p>Knibbs became a staunch advocate of what he termed “The New Malthusianism" and in his book <i>The Shadow of the World's Future</i> (1928) argued that if present growth continued the world would reach its maximum population in less than two hundred and fifty years. Knibbs also provided eugenic arguments for selective migration. He had earlier been active in the eugenics movement, and in 1921 was elected Vice-President of the 2nd International Eugenics Congress held at New York.</p>
<p>Knibbs resigned his position as Commonwealth Statistician in 1921 to become Director of the newly constituted Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry (the forerunner of CSIRO). He was knighted in 1923. He was a man of strong opinions, forthright and public spirited, and was very much motivated by the special problems of his country and his times. He was a forceful advocate but his expectations were often unreasonably high and were not fully met. Nevertheless, his achievements as Commonwealth Statistician were widely applauded internationally and were a model for others. He died in Sydney in 1929.<br />

<p><b>George Waddel SNEDECOR</b><br />
b. 20 October 1881 - d. 15 February 1974<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> George Snedecor is widely known for his text <em>Statistical Methods</em>, first published in 1937, now in its eighth edition. He was the founder of the Iowa State University Statistical Laboratory in 1933, the first unit if its kind in the United States.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>George W. Snedecor is best remembered as a pioneer in making statistical tools accessible to experimenters in agriculture, biology, and other areas of application. Through his work he laid the foundations for what is today the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University, one of the most prestigious of applied statistics departments.</p>
<p>But perhaps his most remarkable contribution was his book, <em>Statistical Methods Applied to Experiments in Agriculture and Biology</em>, published first in 1937, and arguably the most popular and influential statistics text ever written.</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>1. Origins</b></p>
<p>George Waddel Snedecor was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the oldest child of James George Snedecor and Emily Alston Estes. George's father was the descendant of Dutch pioneers who had arrived in the United States in the early part of the 17th century. At the time of George's birth, James Snedecor was a practicing lawyer in Memphis. Soon after George was born, the family moved to Florida and later to Alabama, where his father, by then an ordained Presbyterian minister, preached in churches in and around Birmingham.</p>
<p>Most of young Snedecor's school years were spent in Alabama. In 1899, he began two years of college at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute in Auburn, followed by two years of preparatory school teaching. When the family moved to Tuscaloosa in 1903, George transfered to the University of Alabama. In 1905 he graduated with a B.S. in mathematics and physics, with honors. After graduation, George accepted his first academic job, at the Selma Military Academy. As an instructor he taught at the Academy from 1905 through 1907. He then secured a position in Sherman, Texas, teaching mathematics and Greek at Austin College. It was in Sherman where he met and married Gertrude Douglas Crosier in 1908, the daughter of a dormitory matron at Austin College.</p>
<p>In 1910, the Snedecors moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, while George furthered his education at the University of Michigan. In 1913 he received an A.M. degree with a major in physics.</p>
<p>Finally in 1913, George and Gertrude arrived in Ames, Iowa where they remained until 1958. Both sons, Edward Crosier and James George, were born and raised in Ames. It was there where Snedecor made his mark in the world of statistics.</p>

<p><b>2. The Early Iowa State College Years</b></p>
<p>George W. Snedecor joined the faculty at Iowa State College as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics in 1913. He was quickly promoted to Associate Professor, and in 1915 taught a course entitled “Mathematical Theory of Statistics”. This was the first statistics course designed to formally introduce statistical methods to researchers in the mathematical and other sciences. The name of the course soon changed to “Statistical Methods of Interpreting Experimental Data”, and a second course entitled “Biometric Methods of Interpreting Agricultural Data” was introduced.</p>
<p>By the early 1920s, with several departments across campus offering courses in statistics, researchers in many areas of application were using techniques such as regression analyses on their data. The Graduate College was created in 1920, with the mission of promoting research, particularly in areas of importance to agriculture. Snedecor, with his interest in interdisciplinary research, is likely to have been influential on researchers such as Lindstrom, who by 1925 was using multiple regression models, quite a sophistication for those days (Cox and Homeyer, 1975; Melde, 1990; David, 1998).</p>
<p>In 1927, the Mathematics Statistical Service was established, with Snedecor and A. E. Brandt at the helm. The Service was created to formalize statistical consulting activities, and was the precursor of the Statistical Laboratory, established in 1933. Gertrude Cox (q.v.), who worked part-time in the Mathematics Statistical Service, was the first student to graduate with an M.S. degree in statistics, awarded by the Department of Mathematics in 1931.</p>
<p>By the late 1920s Snedecor was recognized as a preeminent statistician, and in 1931 was promoted to Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Iowa State College. During this time, Snedecor developed an important relationship with R. A. Fisher (q.v.) who was producing path-breaking research at Rothamsted Experimental Station. Their correspondence resulted in two influential six-week visits by Fisher to Iowa State College, in the summers of 1931 and 1936. See also Section 4.</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>3. The Statistical Laboratory Years, 1933-1947</b></p>
<p>In recognition of the importance of statistics in other fields of inquiry, Iowa State College established the Statistical Laboratory in 1933, with Snedecor as its Director. For perhaps the first time in the United States, experimental statistics was officially recognized as a science different from mathematics.</p>
<p>Under Snedecor's direction, the Statistical Laboratory became an active center for the research and teaching of statistics. Many visitors were attracted and the permanent staff was substantially increased as a result of a cooperative agreement in 1938 with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. W. G. Cochran was hired at this time and played a key role in strengthening work in survey sampling and in launching a PhD program in statistics (Cox and Homeyer, 1975).</p>
<p>The 1930s were Snedecor's most active research years. He also carried out the administrative duties as the Director of the Statistical Laboratory, in spite of a profound dislike for paperwork. Indeed, it was his reluctance to take on any additional administrative duties that may have led him to resist the creation of a Department of Statistics in the 1930s. As it was, Gertrude Cox went on to establish the Department of Experimental Statistics at North Carolina State College in 1941, the first in the nation. The Iowa State College Department of Statistics was created in 1947.</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>4. Publications</b></p>
<p>In 1924 Henry A. Wallace, then editor of <em>Wallaces' Farmer</em> and later Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President of the United States, gave a series of ten Saturday afternoon seminars at Iowa State College. He was anxious to pass on to an audience of mainly agricultural and biological research workers the expertise in multiple regression that he had gained primarily in studying the factors influencing corn yields (David, 1998). Wallace summarized these lectures in a bulletin <em>Correlation and Machine Calculation</em> that was put in final shape by Snedecor, one of his listeners. This booklet of just 47 pages (Wallace and Snedecor, 1925) reached worldwide circulation and was Snedecor's first publication, at the age of 42.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter Snedecor became aware of R. A. Fisher's fundamental contributions and was among the first in the United States to recognize their great practical importance. This resulted in a major revision of the bulletin (Wallace and Snedecor, 1931), in a small book in which the F-statistic is introduced (Snedecor, 1934, p. 15) and, most important by far, in <em>Statistical Methods</em> (Snedecor, 1937).</p>
<p><em>Statistical Methods</em> was a phenomenal success, and has gone through eight editions. Snedecor was sole author of the first five, the last three being co-authored by W. G. Cochran. The eighth edition was prepared in 1989 by several members of the Iowa State Statistics Department. Long after the death of the co-authors, the text still had nearly 2000 entries in the Science Citation Index for 1995. Total sales of the editions in English (apart from those published in India) have reached 237,000.</p>
<p>The first edition already makes it plain why this book was to prove so successful. Snedecor had a gift for writing simply and clearly, often using a conversational style. The need for the statistical approach is presented enthusiastically through a series of examples likely to be close to the reader's heart. Snedecor constantly asked questions. There were many tables and charts. The book was studded with helpful and varied exercises. Readers rusty on even elementary mathematics were not ignored. Each topic was introduced unhurriedly and treated in considerable detail, yet a surprising amount of material was covered. Many of the references listed reflected Snedecor's wide experience gained as a consultant to research workers.</p>
<p>In addition, Snedecor filled a real need to satisfy the burgeoning interest of biological research workers in useful statistical methods. The basic texts, Fisher's <em>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</em>, first published in 1925, and followed by <em>The Design of Experiments</em> in 1935, were impressive and written in a masterfully spare English style. But research workers found them very difficult. It is interesting to note that in the course of a warm correspondence with Fisher, Snedecor writes in 1936 that he is working on an elementary text “designed to lead the beginner to an appreciation of your books.” This aim Snedecor accomplished splendidly, even if his presentation was not without occasional shortcomings.</p>
<p>Snedecor's journal articles are mostly in the same spirit of dealing in as simple a way as possible with problems of direct interest to the experimenter. Many of these papers are joint with experimenters or statisticians at Iowa State, on topics including experimental design, analysis of variance and covariance, the chi-square <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">test</a>, disproportionate subclass numbers in multiple classifications, and sampling. Snedecor wrote also on his own on the last two topics, as well as on computing and statistical education and philosophy. The wide knowledge he had gained helping research workers qualified him admirably to be the first editor for Queries in <em>Biometrics</em>, from 1945 to 1958. If the flow of queries from readers was slow, he could draw on his vast consulting experience to manufacture a query!</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>5. The Department of Statistics Years, 1947-1958</b></p>
<p>In 1947 George Snedecor stepped down as Director of the Statistical Laboratory. He remained as Professor of Statistics until his retirement from Iowa State College in 1958.</p>
<p>By the 1940s, Snedecor was recognized throughout the world as an authority in the development of statistical methods. He was an active member of the American Statistical Association (ASA)and the Biometric Society. He served as Vice President of ASA in 1947, and as President in 1948. In 1950 he was elected member of the International Statistical Institute, the 28th from the United States (Cox and Homeyer, 1975). The Royal Statistical Society made him an Honorary Fellow in 1954.</p>
<p>In 1958, Snedecor retired from Iowa State College after 45 years of service. He was responsible for the establishment and flourishing of perhaps the most influential group of applied statisticians in the United States in the first half of the century and his legacy lasts to this day. The Department of Statistics at Iowa State University is now housed in Snedecor Hall, a fitting tribute to the man.</p>
<p>After retirement in San Diego, California, Snedecor retained a lively interest in Statistics until late in life. He was further honored by the award of the Samuel S. Wilks Memorial Medal in 1970, by election as an Honorary Life Member of the Biometric Society in 1971, by a book of papers in his honor (Bancroft, 1972), and posthumously by the setting up in 1976 of <em>The George W. Snedecor Award for the Best Publication in Biometry</em>, administered by the ASA. He died in 1974, at the age of 92, in Amherst, Massachusetts.</p>

<p><b>Anders Nicolai KIAER</b><br />
b. 15 September 1838 - d. 16 April 1919<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Founding Director of the Central Bureau of Statistics in Norway, Kiaer contributed to sample survey and to international statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Anders Nicolai Kiaer was born in the small town of Drammen in Norway. He graduated from the University of Oslo in Law in 1860. He began his career as a civil servant in 1861 and by 1867 he became head of the Statistical Division of the Ministry of the Interior. He soon realised the need for an independent, centralised body responsible for the collection and interpretation of data collected by the various ministries. He therefore became an active spokesman for the establishment of such a body, and in 1876 the Central Bureau of Statistics was established with him as its first Director, a position he held until his retirement in 1913.</p>
<p>As the first director he formulated the basic principles for the statistical agency and gave Norwegian official statistics a framework that still exists today: an independent, centralised statistical office, whose responsibility includes quantitative research in the fields of economy , social science and demography. During his time as Director, together with a very small staff he developed the Norwegian Statistical Office into an efficient and progressive institute. In 1876 the Statistical Office employed one professional and 13 clerks in addition to Kiaer. When he retired, the staff had increased to 33 civil servants. In addition to centralising statistics from various ministries, he was responsible for several censuses of population, agriculture and establishments around the turn of the century, measurement of vital events and several other official investigations. In his work he used a number of “modern" techniques and methods like combining sources at micro as well as at macro level. He performed a number of well designed sample surveys and introduced the use of the newly developed electronic punch cards tabulator as early as in 1894.</p>
<p>Besides founding and developing the Norwegian statistical office into an institute of high national, as well as international standards, Kiaer was promoting the use of statistics as an important tool in the economic and social development of the country. He performed statistical investigations within a number of fields ranging from demographic research, alcohol abuse, public pension schemes to distribution of income and poverty. He was an active member of a number of societies and governmental committees. Within the field of demography he studied mortality and fertility patterns, and compared them with those of other countries. He was particularly interested in studying the fall in the birth rates generally observed around the turn of the century. A major study of fertility was published soon after his death in the <i>Journal of the American Statistical Association</i> in 1919. In that connection the editor noted: “... Hardly any writer anywhere and probably no American is more familiar than Kiaer with the abundant statistical literature dealing with the fall in the birth rate in most civilised countries."</p>
<p>Kiaer also did some pioneering investigations in economic statistics. He was in favour of a proposed system for income taxation, and based on sample survey data on income, occupation and place of residence, he calculated the effects of a number of alternative taxation rules on various population groups. He also calculated the total national income and compared it with similar calculations for other countries. He was, however, critical of these international comparisons as they did not include work done in the households, primarily by women. For Norway he estimated the total value of such activities, and found that it amounted to approximately 15% of the total income. Similar investigations were not repeated until very recent in Norway.</p>
<p>Probably Kiaer's most important contribution to statistics was his pioneering work in the design and use of several sample surveys. He was a pioneer in developing the practice of such surveys, and through his persistent, systematic and detailed defence of the method, vis a vis a sceptical, international audience of statisticians, he cleared the ground for the theoretical development that followed.</p>
<p>In an early survey a sample of forms was extracted from the population census of 1890. For this sample, information from the tax authorities concerning income and property was added to the census form for each person. This procedure made it possible to distribute income by age, sex, occupation and other characteristics. In addition to being a pioneering contribution to survey sampling this investigation is also an early example of combining survey data with administratively collected data at micro level. The sample for this survey was selected in several stages. First a sample of towns and rural communes was selected. Within each selected area males aged 17, 22, 27, 32, etc. and whose names began with certain letters were selected to be included in the sample. The sampling fraction in the towns was 3.1 per cent, while it was 1.54 per cent for the rural communes. In a survey in 1894, data was collected independently of the census. The survey was undertaken to collect data needed for planning and evaluating a proposed retirement pension and sickness insurance scheme. This survey demonstrated the real potential of sample surveys as a collection method by which it is possible to meet ad hoc needs for detailed information. Often such information cannot be collected in a census either because it is needed between two censuses or because the amount of detail needed makes it practically impossible to collect for the whole population. For this survey Kiaer also first selected a sample of towns and rural communes, In the second stage he had to introduce a kind of area sampling, as the census lists were out-dated. In Oslo streets were chosen as second stage units, while the unit varied somewhat in the rest of the country depending on information available. In the last stage addresses were selected systematically by giving a start address and a selection interval for each “street". In the two surveys Kiaer used most of the design methods used today: stratification, selection in several stages, area sampling and unequal selection probabilities. The theory of all these techniques was not developed until many years after Kiaer did this work, but by using intuition and common sense, he managed to select samples which even today would be considered of good quality. Concepts like sampling error and confidence interval and their relationship with sample size were developed much later. However, as a result of his work with several surveys, Kiaer developed some good practical guidelines for evaluating the accuracy of the results from surveys. He was aware that the accuracy depends as much on the selection method applied as on the size of the sample. Furthermore, he knew that some statistical phenomena need a larger and more carefully selected sample than others.</p>
<p>Kiaer presented his results in a series of meetings in the newly established International Statistical Institute (ISI), of which he was a founding member. At his first presentation in Berne in 1895 there was a strong opposition to the use of surveys. This did not discourage Kiaer from continuing his work in the area, and he defended the method at the next ISI meeting, in St. Petersburg four years later. At this meeting there was still a great deal of scepticism about the method, but it was decided to nominate a subcommittee to further study the feasibility of the method. The committee presented its findings at the ISI meeting in Berlin in 1903. The conclusion was that if the sample is carefully selected the survey method could be recommended. It was not until the Rome meeting in 1925 the survey method was again discussed at an ISI meeting. Then the question was not whether to use the method, but rather how to use it.</p>
<p>Kiaer published a large number of articles in French, English and German in addition to Norwegian. A complete bibliography is available from the library of Statistics Norway.<br />

<p><b>Johann Peter SÜSSMILCH</b><br />
b. 3 September 1707 - d. 22 March 1767<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Pastor Süssmilch was the German ancestor of demographic statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The life and career of Johann Peter Süssmilch, minister of St. Peter's church in Berlin-Kölln, were closely related to religious currents in Prussia during the 18th century. A churchman of strict evangelical allegiance, he rose in the hierarchy of the Lutheran church, while at the same time developing his scientific opus as a demographic statistician. He has gradually acquired an international reputation which is well deserved. One may well ask to what an extent he was a representative of the “Aufklärung" (Enlightenment), and how much his researches were inspired by his faith as a man of God.</p>
<p>Süssmilch was born in Zehlendorf near Berlin. His father Elias Süssmilch had travelled in France, England, the Netherlands and most of the German states; he spoke several living languages, but having become a brewer, he devoted himself to his business. It was his maternal grandfather Peter Blell, who probably played the most important role in the development of the future author of <i>Die göttliche Ordnung (The Divine Order)</i>. Süssmilch spent his earliest years in Brandenburg-am-Havel, with his grandfather, who gave him the rudiments of education and enrolled him in the Neustädtische Gymnasium directed by the pietist <a href="#foot42" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a>Caspar Gottschling, who was very close to August Hermann Francke, the inspirer of the pietist movement.</p>
<p>In 1716, Süssmilch studied at the “Grey Cloister" Gymnasium in Berlin; one of his teachers was the co-rector Johann Leonhard Frisch, philologist, naturalist, member of the Academy of Sciences, correspondent of Leibniz and disciple of Philipp Jacob Spener, founder of Berlin pietism. In an autobiographical sketch which appeared shortly before his death, Süssmilch thanked Frisch for awakening his interest in the observation of nature, as a manifestation of God's works. These two forms of knowledge, knowledge of the Creator, and knowledge of his creatures remained indissolubly connected in the works of the minister.</p>
<p>Süssmilch was attracted by medicine, and attended the Theatrum Anatomicum, reorganized by Friedrich-Wilhelm I; he successfully passed an examination in osteology in 1724. But his parents preferred law, and were rather discouraging about their son's medical vocation, so that he gave it up; nevertheless, his work bears the traces of this “repression" of his natural interests. Medicine was replaced by another passion: for it was at this stage that Süssmilch met the Berlin minister Michael Roloff, his first mentor in theology.</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctant to study law, Süssmilch left for Halle, a centre of pietism, in 1727. He became personally involved with Francke, pursued theological studies and made up his deficiency in oriental languages, particularly Hebrew. His education continued in Jena: Süssmilch familiarized himself with Wolffian philosophy, and defended a thesis on the cohesion of physical bodies under the direction of the medical doctor Georg Erhard Hamberger.</p>
<p>Although his time in Jena was of great importance in his scientific development, Süssmilch did not abandon the pietist influences of his childhood and of Halle. From 1728 to 1730, the future minister frequented a community of Herrnhüter <a href="#foot43" id="tex2html2" name="tex2html2"><sup><span class="arabic">2</span></sup></a>, and became involved in teaching and evangelising the poor. It was because of his ties with the pietist circle that he became, through Roloff, the tutor of one of Marshal Christoph von Kalckstein's sons, the Marshal being a familiar of the Court.</p>
<p>After this appointment, Süssmilch's career was secure. In 1736, he became chaplain to the von Kalckstein regiment; it was he who preached the last sermon attended by the dying Friedrich-Wilhelm I. He was appointed to the parish of Etzin, took part in the first Silesian war, and in 1742, against the wishes of Friedrich II who had finally rallied to the evangelical cause, became Pastor Primarius of St. Peter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1741, Süssmilch had published the first version of his major work <i>Die göttliche Ordnung in den Veränderungen des menschlichen Geschlechts, aus der Geburt, Tod, und Fortpflanzung desselben erwiesen (The Divine Order in the Changes of the Human Species, as Demonstrated by its Birth, Death and Propagation)</i>.</p>
<p>In this work, Süssmilch declared himself explicitly a follower of English physico-theology, more specifically of William Derham, the author of <i>Physico-Theology</i> (1713). The entire training and development of Süssmilch effectively led him to uphold the traditional argument on Divine Providence, and the incontestability of the Divine Word as revealed by Scripture. He sought to demonstrate through a careful examination of empirical data, that the laws governing humanity were as formal and undeniable as those of Newtonian mechanics. Thus, three major currents of thought of 18th century Europe combined in the minister's work: Lutheran faith coloured by pietism, Anglo-Dutch physio-theology born of Newtonian philosophy and demographic statistics. Süssmilch was fully aware of his predecessors in statistical research, and his concerns were never far removed from those of the “political arithmeticians". But he was not an innovator; rather he was a compiler. The publication of <i>Die göttliche Ordnung</i> resulted in the author's election to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. He contributed regularly to the activities of this learned society. The Memoirs which he read there, some of which were published, revealed his three interests: history, linguistics and demographic statistics. For Süssmilch, it was clear that these three areas of knowledge sprang from a single idea: God ruled over the world through the hand of His Providence.</p>
<p>The minister indulged in some polemics, launched into some business deals such as the Berlin-Potsdam-Berlin stagecoach, and a plantation of mulberry trees in Friedrichshagen, and he became a censor. Armed with his numerical data, of which he could never have enough, he tried to act as a private councillor to Friedrich II on questions of population. This was vain, for the king ignored his “reprimands" and Süssmilch had to content himself with ecclesiastical preferment, first becoming inspector of parishes, then <i>Konsistorialrat</i> <a href="#foot48" id="tex2html3" name="tex2html3"><sup><span class="arabic">3</span></sup></a>.</p>
<p>But the statistician in him never lost sight of his magnum opus. He continued to collect data and gathered his academic contributions to publish, 20 years after its first edition, a corrected and considerably augmented second edition of <i>Die göttliche Ordnung</i> in 1761-62. This work is a vast compendium of demographic data, socio-economic analyses, and polemics against the great thinkers of the day, among them Montesquieu. While maintaining the essence of his fundamental theses, this rich compilation, even more than his youthful work, can be thought of as the illustration of the divine commandment: Increase and Multiply. For Süssmilch the peopling of the earth was one of the realisations of the Divine Goal for man, God's privileged creature. The minister had himself contributed to this goal with his wife Charlotte Dorothea Lieberkühn, whom he had married in 1737, by fathering 10 children, of whom 9 survived, a remarkable feat for that period.</p>
<p>The last published work of Süssmilch in 1766 (he died within a year) was the important <i>Versuch eines Beweises, dass die erste Sprache ihren Ursprung nicht vom Menschen, sondern allein vom Schöpfer erhalten habe. (Essay on the Proof that the First Language did not Originate with Man, but with God Alone)</i>. Three years before, the minister had suffered a stroke and was half paralyzed. A third edition of <i>Die göttliche Ordnung</i> similar to the second had been published in 1765. Eleven years later, in 1776, Süssmilch's nephew by marriage, Christian Jacob Baumann, published the book again, with a number of “additions and complements" in which he made use of the minister's data in a somewhat idiosyncratic fashion.</p>
<p>While he never made any discoveries in the area of statistical method, Süssmilch, by bringing together the most extensive set of available data of his time, was known in his lifetime to German speaking Europeans, and in particular recognized by the Dutchman Struyck and the Swede Wargentin, both important figures in the history of demographic statistics. <i>Die göttliche Ordnung</i> of 1761-62, translated into Dutch in 1770, discussed in England, tolerably well known and respected in Germany, where Süssmilch may be justly regarded as the father of demographic statistics, was translated in part and published in France by Jacqueline Hecht of the Institut National d'Études Démographiques (INED) in 1978. The appearance in 1998 of an annotated edition with commentaries of this opus princeps of 1741, extends her effort, so essential to the history of demography and statistics, of which Süssmilch was undoubtedly one of the main founders.<br />

<p><b>John Maynard KEYNES</b><br />
b. 5 June 1883 - d. 21 April 1946<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Keynes was a philosopher-economist whose abiding interest in logical argument, probability and statistics, and his fertility and originality in economic theory and policy, made him one of the most influential figures of the 20th century.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Born in Cambridge, England, to a middle class family, Keynes was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge. He later achieved greatest fame as an economist, but he never took an economics degree. Although his undergraduate studies were in mathematics, his intellectual passion at that time was philosophy, the primary influence here being G.E. Moore, the noted ethical philosopher. Grappling with Moore's arguments about morality, in fact, led Keynes to formulate the germ of his ideas on probability in 1904. It was only after completing his mathematics degree that he began the concentrated study of economics, his main mentor being Alfred Marshall. During his first period of employment in the British Civil Service at the India Office where he worked on economics and statistics, he submitted a fellowship dissertation on `The Principles of Probability'. A revised version in 1908 won him a fellowship at King's College in 1909. Eventually published in 1921 as a <i>Treatise on Probability</i>, it had a significant impact on the philosophy of probability at the time, but its influence has since waned considerably. Nevertheless it remains central to understanding his thinking on logic, probability, rationality, and statistical inference. In 1908, while re-working his dissertation, he even envisaged his future field of academic expertise to be Logic and Statistical Theory. Marshall had other ideas, however, and offered an Economics lectureship which Keynes accepted because it provided a means of returning to Cambridge from London. During World War I, he worked in the British Treasury and was a delegate to the Versailles Conference in 1919. Finding the reparations conditions imposed on Germany economically and morally outrageous, he resigned and wrote <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i>, the first book that made him world-famous.</p>
<p>For the rest of his life Keynes was mainly engaged with economics, though other interests also absorbed his attention such as politics and the arts. In economics, where his output was enormous and influential, he focused on theoretical and practical issues as well as individual countries and the world economy. Inflation and exchange rate instability were early concerns in the 1920s, followed by unemployment during the 1930s Great Depression, and inflation again during the 1940s war years. His magnum opus in economics was <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i> of 1936, a pioneering work that established modern macroeconomics, created Keynesian economics as a serious alternative to Neoclassical economics, and stimulated the development of National Accounting statistics. During World War II, he again assisted the British war effort in the Treasury. In his final years, he played a key role in the negotiations that shaped the institutions which dominated the post-war international economy - the Bretton Woods system, the IMF, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In 1925 he married the Russian ballerina, Lydia Lopokova, but there were no children. He died of a heart attack in 1946, brought on by over-work.</p>
<p>It was as a young man that Keynes did the bulk of his work on probability and statistics. The years 1908-12 saw nine contributions to the <i>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society (JRSS)</i> and several on statistical subjects to the <i>Economic Journal (EJ)</i>. These were concerned with index numbers, a critique of Elderton and Pearson (q.v.) (see below), reviews of seven European works on probability and statistics (by Borel (q.v.), Czuber, Poincaré, Bachelier (q.v.), Carvello, Markov (q.v.) and Horrowicz), and the theory of averages where Keynes argued that popular preference for the arithmetic mean was misplaced since it did not always provide the most probable value. In 1909 he wrote a long, prize-winning essay on Index Numbers.</p>
<p>In the philosophy of probability, Keynes is best known as a founder of the logical theory of probability, a rival to the relative frequency and subjective theories. His ideas are set out in his philosophical magnum opus, the <i>Treatise on Probability</i>. This is not a mathematical work on the probability calculus, but a philosophical work concerned with logic and rationality. Keynes argued that probability is <i>the general logic of rational but non-conclusive argument</i>, within which deductive logic is the special case of complete certainty or unit probabilities. This view conceives of probability as a logical relation between a conclusion, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/56/l2h/img1.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> , and premisses or data, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ h$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/56/l2h/img2.png" title="$ h$" width="16" /></span> , which give partial support to <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/56/l2h/img3.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> . Keynes's symbol for probability is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ a/h$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/56/l2h/img4.png" title="$ a/h$" width="35" /></span> , which emphasises the data-dependence of probabilities. Probabilities express degrees of partial inference (the degree to which <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/56/l2h/img5.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> may be inferred from <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ h$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/56/l2h/img6.png" title="$ h$" width="16" /></span> ), and degrees of rational belief (the degree to which it is rational to believe <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/56/l2h/img7.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> , given <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ h$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/56/l2h/img8.png" title="$ h$" width="16" /></span> ). Such probabilities may be numerical (the smaller class) or non-numerical (the larger class), and may be known or unknown. The means by which we obtain knowledge of probabilities is logical insight or intuition into the realm of (objective) logical relations between pairs of propositions. On these foundations, Keynes derived the probability calculus, developed a theory of induction, explored objective chance and randomness, and outlined a theory of rational conduct. He also investigated statistical inference, his object being to analyse `the logical basis of statistical modes of argument', and to engage in the <i>dual task</i> of discrediting invalid inferences and analysing valid ones. He traversed the law of large numbers, the theorems of Bernoulli (q.v.), Poisson (q.v.) and Chebychev (q.v.), Laplace's (q.v.) rule of succession and the methods of Lexis (q.v.), and sketched the outline of a constructive theory. The following passages illustrate his dual task and his preference for logic over algebra:</p>
<blockquote>Such is the famous theorem of Bernoulli which some have believed to have a universal validity and to be applicable to <i>all</i> 'properly calculated' probabilities. Yet the theorem exhibits algebraical rather than logical insight. And ... it is only true of a special class of cases and requires conditions, before it can be legitimately applied, of which the fulfilment is rather the exception than the rule.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I conclude ... that the application of the mathematical methods, discussed in the preceding chapter [the inversion of Bernoulli's theorem and Laplace's rule of succession], to the general problem of statistical inference is invalid. ... To apply these methods to material, unanalysed in respect of the circumstances of its origin, and without reference to our general body of knowledge, merely on the basis of arithmetic and of those of the characteristics of our material with which the methods of descriptive statistics are competent to deal, can only lead to error and to delusion. But I go further than this in my opposition to them. Not only are they the children of loose thinking, and the parents of charlatanry. Even when they are employed by wise and competent hands, I doubt whether they represent the most fruitful form in which to apply technical and mathematical methods to statistical problems, except in a limited class of special cases. The methods associated with the names of Lexis, Von Bortkiewicz, and Tschuprow ... seem to me to be much more clearly consonant with the principles of sound induction.</blockquote>
<p>Studying the history of thought, to Keynes, was a `necessary preliminary to the emancipation of the mind'. He was extremely well read in the history of probability and statistics, and made his own contributions through biographical essays. In 1936, he delivered an invited paper to the Royal Statistical Society celebrating the centenary of the birth of W.S. Jevons (q.v.). Published in the <i>JRSS</i>, the paper explored Jevons's contributions to economics and statistics, noting his `fertility and originality of mind' in relation to index numbers and the importance of his inductive studies. Other thinkers were commemorated through obituaries, mainly in the <i>EJ</i>- W. Lexis (1914), who developed new statistical concepts of `the utmost importance'; F.Y. Edgeworth (q.v.) (1926), who ranged over economics, psychology, probability, statistics and index numbers; A. Chuprov (q.v.) (1926), `one of the most important writers' on the boundary between statistical theory and probability; C.P. Sanger (1930), `at one time a leading authority on mathematical and statistical economics'; F.P. Ramsey (1930), a critic of Keynes in probability, a founder of the modern subjective theory and `one of the brightest minds of our generation'; and G. Broomhall (1938), who was `perhaps the greatest practical statistician of our age'.</p>
<p>All his life Keynes strongly advocated the collection and analysis of statistical information by government agencies. Such information was crucial to rational decision making in both the public and private sectors. Government had a `natural duty' in this area, where its activities were to be guided by the general principles of completeness, openness and timeliness. `There ought', he stated in 1943, `to be very little indeed within the knowledge of Government departments which should not also be made more widely available'. In the absence of such official statistics, he was instrumental, with A.L. Bowley (q.v.), W. Beveridge and others, in establishing the London and Cambridge Economic Service in 1923, the purpose of which was to publish monthly bulletins of economic statistics to inform business about current facts and trends, and to provide them with various indices, charts and memoranda. In the 1930s he supported the establishment of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, an independent research organisation with a strong interest in statistical information, and served on its Council. Charles Madge and Mass Observation received his encouragement in the 1940s, Keynes praising one of Madge's projects as `an enquiry of first class importance'. Also receiving his firm backing in the 1930s and 40s was the founding and development of the Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge University.</p>
<p>Keynes was involved in two statistical controversies in his life-time. The first, in 1910-11, concerned a study by Ethel Elderton and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> of the influence of parental alcoholism on children; this concluded that parental drinking had no harmful effects on offspring. Keynes attacked the study on methodological grounds in the <i>JRSS</i>: `It is a question, not of facts, but of the nature of valid argument which is in dispute'. In his view, the study was `misleading', `almost valueless', and an example of the application of `a needlessly complex mathematical apparatus' to data which were `unsuited to the problem in hand'. The controversy, which embraced the press, other Cambridge economists and the medical profession, had a significant impact on Keynes, for it motivated him to expand his initially modest discussion of statistics in his dissertations into a section on `The Foundations of Statistical Inference' in the <i>Treatise on Probability</i>.</p>
<p>The second controversy occurred in 1938-40 when Keynes wrote a critical review of Jan Tinbergen's statistical study of the determinants of investment which had been commissioned by the League of Nations. His wide-ranging critique again centred on methodology - the logic of applying multiple correlation analysis to material which varied over time, and the difficulties of drawing inductive conclusions. The strength of Keynes's remarks, including the use of terms such as `statistical alchemy', `black magic' and `charlatanism', led many to the view that he was hostile to the whole econometrics enterprise, but this view is mistaken. As he made quite clear in two final letters to Pigou and Lange, he was <i>not</i> disputing `the validity of any conceivable statistical method' but only `Tinbergen's very special method of analysis'.</p>
<p>Keynes also made notable contributions to professional societies. Apart from his unparalleled service to the Royal Economic Society and the <i>EJ</i>, he was a long-term member of the Royal Statistical Society, and served on its Council for three periods (1915-19, 1933-37, 1941-45). In the Econometric Society, he played an equally constructive role. One of its founding fellows, he served on its Council from 1934 to 1946 and was elected president in 1944 and 1945. In 1945, he supported Tinbergen as a candidate for Vice-President, there being no-one `for whose work one could be more anxious to give every possible scope and opportunity'.</p>
<p>Keynes's deep interest in statistics grew out of his trin loves of philosophy and economics. He held statistical information in high regard as a necessary input of rational thought and policy-making, and he also supported statistical inference, albeit more circumspectly. His prime concern here, as with formalism generally, was methodological - the appropriateness of the application of statistical techniques to the material under investigation. This made him a severe and hostile critic of <i>inappropriate</i> applications of formal methods, whether in mathematics, statistics or econometrics, and it was his attacks on such `pseudo-science' which gave rise to the superficial and mistaken view that he was generally antipathetic to the use of formal methods in the social sciences. The dominant characteristic of Keynes's approach to statistics, as with formal methods generally, was an insistance on philosophical and logical integrity in their application. It was always his view that logical and conceptual reasoning took precedence over mathematical virtuosity and technical sophistication. His motto, if he had had one in this area, would have been something like <i>ratio ante computationem</i> (reason before calculation).<br />

<p><b>Summary.</b> Jevons pioneered the use of mathematics in economics, taking a greater interest in statistics than any of the other great economists.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>W.S. Jevons was one of the most influential economists of his age. Although he was not the first scholar to apply sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques to the study of economic problems and theories, he was by far the most effective early advocate and practitioner of the `mathematical theory of political economy'.</p>
<p>His <i>Notice of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy</i> attracted no notice whatever when read before the British Association Meeting at Cambridge in 1862, and was barely noticed when published in the <i>Statistical Journal</i> in 1866. But the developed version of this short paper, published as <i>The Theory of Political Economy</i> in 1871, was to be identified by J.M. Keynes (q.v.) as `the first modern book on economics'. And in his <i>Business Cycles</i> (1927), Wesley C. Mitchell wrote that `It was left for W. Stanley Jevons to give the first powerful impetus to statistical work in economic theory'.</p>
<p>Jevons was born in Liverpool, England. In 1853, at the age of 18, he had interrupted his studies in mathematics and chemistry at University College, London in order to accept a lucrative position as an assayer at a new branch of the (British) Royal Mint at Sydney. His official duties during the succeeding five years (1854-59) left him time to pursue a wide range of scientific interests, many of which involved the use of statistics. The most important publication of Jevons' Australian years was in the field of meteorology (`Some Data concerning the Climate of Australia and New Zealand'), in which he provided some remarkably accurate descriptions of climate fluctuations in Australia, based on very limited data.</p>
<p>In a paper on clouds published in 1858, Jevons appears to have been the first researcher to entirely discard electricity as having a role in the explanation of meteorological phenomena, and also the first to observe the phenomenon now called `salt fingers'.</p>
<p>In the same year Jevons produced his `Social Statistics or the Science of Towns especially as regards London and Sydney'. Though it remained unpublished, this work is of great significance as a pioneering exercise in urban sociology which anticipated his subsequent achievement as statistician and economist.</p>
<p>Soon after his return to England, Jevons was at work on a `Statistical Atlas': a collection of charts or diagrams of economic and social variables - in effect, the representation of time series in graphical form, which Jevons believed was as essential to the economist as were maps to the geographer.</p>
<p>He then embarked upon a remarkable series of studies of commercial fluctuations and prices. In 1936, J.M. Keynes was to identify the first of these (`On the Study of Periodic Commercial Fluctuations'), read before the British Association in 1862, as marking `the beginning of a new stage in economic science'. Jevons `was not the first to plot economic statistics in diagrams', said Keynes, but `he compiled and arranged economic statistics for a new purpose and pondered them in a new way'.</p>
<p>In the succeeding year Jevons published, at his own expense, the pamplet `A Serious Fall in the Price of Gold ascertained, and its Social Effects set forth'. This was an investigation of the effect of the gold discoveries in Australia and California upon the prices of commodities. In this pamphlet, Jevons was able to combine the historical and practical knowledge of gold and currency matters which he had acquired in his Australian post with a rare capacity to confront and resolve conceptual problems. It was of this work that Keynes was to write:</p>
<blockquote>Jevons had to solve the problem of price index-numbers practically from the beginning; and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that he made as much progress in this brief pamphlet as has been made by all succeeding authors put together. He examines the logical and dialectical problem, the question of weighting, the choice between an arithmetic and geometric mean, whether articles which have moved abnormally should be excluded, and, generally speaking, what classes of commodities can best be taken as representative. <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \ldots$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/54/l2h/img1.png" title="$ \ldots$" width="27" /></span> For unceasing fertility and originalitry of mind applied, with a sure touch and unfailing control of the material, to a mass of statistics, involving immense labours for an unaided individual ploughing his way through with no precedents and labour-saving devices to relieve his task, this pamphlet stands unrivalled in the history of our subject.</blockquote>
<p>Many have assumed that `our subject', to Keynes, was economics. In fact, his audience was the Royal Statistical Society, not the Economic Society. In his paper Keynes recalled Jevons' decision, at the age of 28, to have himself `proposed and perhaps elected a Fellow of the Statistical Society as <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \ldots$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/54/l2h/img2.png" title="$ \ldots$" width="27" /></span> possible acquaintance with other statisticians will be of high advantage to me'; and to the fact that, during his years in London, Jevons `frequently attended our [i.e., the Statistical Society's] meetings'. He was duly elected to the Fellowship of the London [now Royal] Statistical Society, and read further pathbreaking econometric studies before the Society in each of the two succeeding years.</p>
<p>In 1869, at the age of 34, Jevons produced the earliest model of his `Logic Machine'. This device consisted of keys, levers and pulleys, and was something of a cross between a logical abacus and a piano. It was the first machine that could solve a logical problem faster than that problem could be solved without using the machine. In the same year, Jevons was elected President of the Manchester Statistical Society, and President of the Economic Science and Statistics Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Significantly, his Presidential Address focussed upon the meaning and importance of `Statistics'. It was published in the <i>Journal of the Statistical Society</i> (September 1870), a testament to the fact that its author took a greater interest in statistics, and gave stronger and more continuous support to statistical institutions, than any of the other great economists.</p>
<p>Jevons' statistical investigations were related mainly, but by no means entirely, to the contributions to economics for which he has achieved lasting fame. Among papers which were not specifically related to economic issues were `Statistics of Shakespearean Literature' (<i>Athenaeum</i>, 12 March 1864), which Stigler has identified as an early `social indicator'; `On a General System of Numerically Definite Reasoning' (Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, January 1870); and various papers on the so-called Brownian movement of microscopic particles which have their place in the history of the investigation of random processes.</p>
<p>Jevons was accidentally drowned in 1882, in Hastings, England at the age of 46. His biography in Britain's <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> pointed to his reputation `as a statistician of vast industry and rare gifts of combination, and an economist of high original power'; and by 1936 Lionel Robbins was to write that `Since his death, (Jevons) has been recognised universally as one of the most outstanding figures in the history of economic thought'.<br />

<p><b>Harold JEFFREYS</b><br />
b. 22 April 1891 - d. 18 March 1989<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Harold Jeffreys, a distinguished British geophysicist, advocated and justified the use of probability to describe one's beliefs about scientific ideas, and developed powerful methods for interpreting scientific data through probability.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The career of Harold Jeffreys (1891-1989) is easily described. From his local school in County Durham, he sent up to Cambridge, where he stayed for the rest of his life. His continuous 75 years as a fellow of St. John's College is a record for any Oxbridge college. He was Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy, received numerous scientific awards and was knighted.</p>
<p>During most of his life, and certainly up until his retirement from the Chair in 1958, he was best known for his important work in geophysics and related fields. His book, <i>The Earth: Its Origin, History and Physical Constitution</i>, is a classic. One of the problems he studied was that of the transmission of earthquake waves through the earth and, in particular, the interpretation of seismological data. As a result, he became interested in statistical problems. This interest was enhanced by the attention paid in Cambridge of the 1920's to the philosophy of science. This combination of philosophy with scientific data culminated in the publication in 1939 of his other great book, called simply <i>Theory of Probability</i>. The substantially revised third edition appeared in 1961. It is still in print and is considered by many statisticians to be essential reading, not just for historical reasons, but because of its modern manner of thought. As Barnard said “There are a few [books] that are so far ahead of their time that they are initially neglected and only reach their peak many years after publication". He was a poor oral communicator but his writing is superb. He stands, with literature's greatest, in the effective use of the English language.</p>
<p>There are two major novelties in the <i>Theory</i>, as he liked to call his book. The first lies in the concept of probability: the second in the development, from this concept, of practical procedures for handling data. He addressed the problem of how one's uncertainty about quantities of scientific interest, like hypotheses or values of constants, should be described. In the first chapter he demonstrated, on the basis of some simple ideas, in effect used as axioms, that this could only be done through probability; so that one could speak of the probability of a hypothesis being true. Furthermore, statements of these uncertainties had to combine according to the rules of probability. One of these rules is Bayes's theorem and because of its ubiquity, the subject, when treated from this viewpoint, has become known as Bayesian statistics. The theory was the first modern book on Bayesian statistics. This attitude towards probability was quite different from that of his near-contemporary, R.A. Fisher (q.v.), who was, in the 1930s, revolutionizing statistics. Fisher used only the probability of the data, given the hypothesis, whereas Jeffreys was advocating and justifying the concept of the probability of the hypothesis, given the data. Fisher's ideas found general acceptance and Jeffreys was initially treated as a maverick.</p>
<p>Views like Jeffreys's were also being developed by F.P. Ramsey (also in Cambridge) and de Finetti in Italy. They were later to be expounded in the 1950s by L.J. Savage in the States. Jeffreys went further than these workers and developed operational techniques for handling data. Fisher was doing the same and it was possible to compare the two procedures on a data set. At the same time there weemed to be good agreement but later work has revealed important differences which are especially noticeable in the testing of hypotheses. Fisher's <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a> built on earlier ideas and used the concept of a tail area. If, on hypothesis <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img1.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> , a statistic <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img2.png" title="$ x$" width="15" /></span> has probability density <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p(x\vert H)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img3.png" title="$ p(x\vert H)$" width="62" /></span> , the tail-area probability associated with the observed value <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img4.png" title="$ x$" width="15" /></span> is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \int^{\infty}_{x}p(t\vert H)dt$" border="0" height="40" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img5.png" title="$ \int^{\infty}_{x}p(t\vert H)dt$" width="104" /></span> , sometimes called a <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ P$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img6.png" title="$ P$" width="19" /></span> -value, or significance level. Jeffreys proceeded quite differently and in an original argument calculated the probability of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img7.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> , given <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img8.png" title="$ x$" width="15" /></span> , <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p(H\vert x)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img9.png" title="$ p(H\vert x)$" width="62" /></span> . This was based on a prior probability of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img10.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> , which he took to be <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 1/2$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img11.png" width="33" /></span> . In important numerical cases <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p(H\vert x)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img12.png" title="$ p(H\vert x)$" width="62" /></span> can differ substantially from the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ P$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img13.png" title="$ P$" width="19" /></span> -value. An advantage of the broader view of probability is that the resulting numbers, unlike <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img14.png" title="$ p$" width="14" /></span> -values, are exactly those required for decision-making. Although Jeffreys, as the pure scientist in his college, never considered decisions, his general treatment has been found effective in management science and other fields.</p>
<p>Jeffreys differed from de Finetti in regarding the numerical value of a probability as being shared by all rational persons, whereas de Finetti thought of it as subjective. According to the latter view, scientific objectivity only arises after substantial amounts of data, relevant to a problem, have drawn differing subjective views into agreement. If Jeffreys was right, he had to have some way of producing the rational probability. The way he explored, and which later workers have followed, is first to describe a rational view of ignorance. If a probability that represented knowing nothing about a quantity, an extreme form of uncertainty, could be developed, then any knowledge could update that probability by Bayes's theorem, to produce rational opinions in the light of that knowledge. Ignorance played the role of an origin. For example, a probability of <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 1/2$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/53/l2h/img15.png" title="$ 1/2$" width="33" /></span> seems to correspond to knowing nothing about whether a hypothesis is true or not, being neutral between the two possibilities. A major advance in the later editions of the Theory was the development of a probabilistic description of ignorance using invariance concepts. Jeffreys was the first to recognise some inadequacies in his suggestions but they have been very fruitful in leading later workers to develop them into what nowadays are called `reference' or `default' probabilities.</p>
<p>Jeffreys's views have influenced the philosophy of science, and are in marked contrast to those of Karl Popper, who advocated the view that a hypothesis could only be disproved, whereas probability admitted values near one, effectively amounting to proof. An important illustration of the effect of this probabilistic thinking on social and scientific questions is provided by contemporary studies of global warming. Is it taking place, due to industrial and other pollutants, and, if it is, what will be its magnitude? The probability school would calculate the probability of warming using available data, and the conditional probability of its magnitude, given that it exists. Decisions based on these probabilities can then be made rationally. Generally, discourse on important questions involving uncertainty should be conducted in the language of probability.</p>
<p>Jeffreys worked largely on his own but his earlier, philosophical ideas were developed with Dorothy Wrinch, who later became well-known as an opponent of the ideas of Linus Pauling. In 1940 he married Bertha Swirles. They co-authored a splendid book on <i>The Methods of Mathematical Physics</i>. Jeffreys was a great geophysicist who also created an original way of conducting the scientific method.<br />

<p><b>Jakob BERNOULLI</b><br />
b. 6 January 1655 - d. 16 August 1705<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Jacob Bernoulli, together with his brother Johann one of the pioneers of the Leibnizian form of the calculus, transformed Huygens' calculus of expectations to make probability its main concept. He formulated and proved the weak law of large numbers, the cornerstone of modern probability and statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Bernoulli stemmed from a family of merchants. His grandfather Jakob Bernoulli became a citizen of Basel in 1622 by marriage. His father, Nikolaus Bernoulli, took over the drug business from his father and became a member of the town council. After finishing the master of arts in 1671 Jakob Bernoulli studied theology until 1676 when he received the licentiate in theology; at the same time he studied mathematics and astronomy secretly against the will of his father. After 1676 he left Basel to work as a tutor for four years which he spent in Geneva and France. He also travelled to France, the Netherlands, England and Germany in 1681, 1682. His first publication,in 1681, dealt with his observations of the comet of 1680 and his prediction of its reappearance in 1719. Back in Basel he began to give private lectures especially on the mechanics of solid and liquid bodies and he became interested in analysis. Two years after its foundation in 1682 Leibniz had published in the Acta Eruditorum a method to determine integrals of algebraic functions, a short presentation of the differential calculus in algorithmic form and some remarks concerning the fundamental ideas of the integral calculus. These papers occupied the interest of Jakob and his brother Johann Bernoulli. Jakob tried to get further information from Leibniz in 1687 but he answered Jakob's questions only three years later because of a journey undertaken in diplomatic mission. At that time Jakob and Johann had not only mastered the Leibnizian calculus but also had added so considerably to it that Leibniz wrote in a letter of 1694 that the infinitesimal calculus owes as much to the Bernoulli brothers as to himself.</p>
<p>Jakob also cultivated the theory of series which were published in five dissertations between 1689 and 1704. He considered series as the universal means to integrate arbitrary functions, to square and rectify curves. In 1690 Jakob had introduced the term “integral" in his solution of the problem to determine the curve of constant descent. In the 90's the relationship between Jakob and Johann deteriorated mainly because of the hot and excitable temper of the very ambitious younger Johann. The bitter quarrels between them became as notorious as the priority dispute between Leibniz and Newton, which began at about the same time, concerning the creation of the infinitesimal calculus.</p>
<p>In 1687 Jakob became professor of mathematics at the university of Basel, in which position he remained until his death in 1705. He was honoured by the memberships of the Académie Royale des Science (1699) and of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin (1701). He had a daughter and a son from Judith Stupan whom he had married in 1684. His most famous monograph is the <i>Ars conjectandi</i> (or Art of Conjecturing) which was only published after his death in 1713. This represents the transition from the calculus of chances as developed by <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=49" name="menu0">Christiaan Huygens</a> (q.v.) in 1657 to a new mathematical theory centered around the concept of probability the classical measure of which was also introduced by Jakob Bernoulli.</p>
<p>The <i>Ars conjectandi</i>, generally considered as Bernoulli's most original work, remained incomplete. It consists of four parts. The first is a reprint of Huygens' <i>De ratiociniis in aleae ludo</i>, which was published in 1657, complemented by extensive annotations which contained important modifications and generalizations preparing something new, the theory of probability theory. In the second part Bernoulli deals with the theory of combinations. In the third part Bernoulli gives twenty-four examples concerning the determination of the modified Huygenian concept of expectation in various games. The fourth part is the most interesting and original. At the same time it is the part which Bernoulli was not able to complete. In the first three of its five chapters it deals with the new central concept, probability, its relation to certainty, necessity and chance, and ways to estimate and measure it. In chapter 4 Bernoulli distinguishes two ways to determine exactly or approximately the classical measure of probability. The first presupposes equipossibility of the outcomes of certain elementary events like drawing either one of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/52/l2h/img1.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> balls numbered from 1 to <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/52/l2h/img2.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> out of an urn. So the probability to draw a ball of a certain colour out of an urn filled with balls of different colours is determined <i>a priori</i> by the ratio of the number of balls of this special colour to the number of all balls in the urn. For the determination of the probability of an event like dying of a certain person within the next ten years a reduction to numbers of equipossible cases which are favourable or unfavourable for the event is impossible. But according to Bernoulli we can inductively, by experiments, or <i>a posteriori</i> in his sense, get as close as we desire to the true measure of such a probability. The possibility to estimate the unknown probability of such an event by the relative frequency of the outcome of this event in a series of supposedly independent trials is secured according to Jakob Bernoulli by his theorema aureum, which was called later, by Poisson, Bernoulli's law of large numbers. The proof of this theorem is contained in chapter 5. In an appendix Jakob Bernoulli treats the jeu de paume, a ball game usually considered as a predecessor of tennis, as a game of chance.</p>
<p>The idea to give his book the title <i>Ars conjectandi</i> was stimulated by the <i>Ars Cogitandi</i>, better known as the Logic of Port Royal, in the very last chapter of which the chances for future contingent events are equated with the ratios of the associated degrees of probability. One can see how Bernoulli, beginning from this notion, developed the classical concept of probability, and how he established as its measure a generalization of Huygens' expectation, namely, the ratio of favorable to all possible cases. At the same time he became the first to set down the prerequisites for consciously formulating a program for the mathematization of all the fields of application subject to “probabilis". Bernoulli himself sought to execute this program, but his premature death prevented him.</p>
<p>Jakob's interest in stochastics began in the 1680's. His first publication on the calculus of chances dates from 1685. The development of his ideas can at least in part be traced in the Meditationes, his so-called scientific diary, which he had begun in 1677. It shows the significance of jurisprudence for the transition from a calculus of chance to a calculus of probability. This is accompanied by Leibniz independent and lifelong interest in a doctrine or a logic of degrees of probabilities triggered by the hope to quantify conditional rights but also in the dissertation of Niklaus Bernoulli, Jakob's nephew, who sought to apply the findings of his uncle to a series of concrete problems in law. Different from Jakob Bernoulli Leibniz never worked out his ideas in this field. He left only a series of partly redundant drafts and manuscripts but no publication. Jakob Bernoulli learned only late in his life of Leibniz' interest in a doctrine of probabilities. This is testified by the correspondence between the two men from April 1703 until Jakob's death in 1705. Jakob Bernoulli took Leibniz' objections, especially against the significance of his law of large numbers, as representative of a critical reader and tried to refute them in part 4 of the <i>Ars conjectandi</i>. Leibniz emphasized that in the area of jurisprudence and politics, which was so important for Bernoulli's program, no extended calculations were usually required, since an enumeration of the relevant conditions would suffice. Against the possibility of attaining a better approximation to a sought after probability with an increasing number of observations, Leibniz suggested that contingent events, here identified with dependence on infinitely many conditions, could not be determined by a finite number of experiments. In addition, e. g., the appearance of new diseases could change the probability of survival of a person with a certain age. However, Bernoulli saw no problem with applying an urn model to human mortality, with the stones corresponding to diseases with which a person can be taken ill. So Bernoulli's research program stood firm after his discovery of the law of large numbers in 1689.</p>
<p>The content of the <i>Ars conjectandi</i> in its most important sections went back to preliminary studies he had done in the 1680's as testified by the Meditationes. A key passage for the transformation of Huygens' expectation to probability involves the treatment of a problem of law, on which Bernoulli worked in 1685/86. It has to do with a marriage contract, which, assuming that the couple have children and that the wife (Caja) dies before the husband (Titius), will govern the division of their common property between the father and the children. The portion of the groom will be larger if he has already entered into his inheritance, smaller if not, unless both fathers have died. The bride's father objects to his initial proposal; this induces Titius to make a second proposal, according to which he will receive the same portion of the common property regardless of what happens to the fathers. On this basis Bernoulli poses the question: which suggestion would be more favorable for the children? To this end he has to make assumptions about the possible order of death of the three people involved, the two fathers and Caja. He first assumes that all six possible orders have equal weight. But this assumption does not satisfy him, since the youth of the bride has not been taken into account. Thus, he assumes that for every two instances e.g., diseases, symptoms or events which might bring about the death of either father, there is only one which threatens Caja with death. There are thus five cases in all, each equally likely to take its victim first. Since Caja is affected by only one of these, while the two fathers are affected by four, her situation is evaluated as one-fifth of certainty of her being first to die, that is, “one probability, five of which make the entire certainty". Here Bernoulli uses the plural “probabilities", where these are equated with the no more precisely distinguished individual cases; this usage does not permit the conception of “probability" as “degree of certainty" which is observed in the next stage. Aided by Huygens' formula for determining expectation, Bernoulli then derives a certainty of 4/15, written 4/15 c, where “c" stands for “certitudo", or 4 probabilities our of 15, that Caja will die second, and finally 8/15 c that she will die third. At the end of his treatment of the marriage contract he speaks of the degree of probability:</p>
<blockquote>“Generally in civic and moral affaires things are to be understood, in which we of course know that the one thing is more probable, better or more advisable than another; but by what degree of probability or goodness they exceed others we determine only according to probability, not exactly. The surest way of estimating probabilities in these cases is not a priori, that is by cause, but a posteriori, that is, from the frequently observed event in similar examples."</blockquote>
<p>Bernoulli carried out the determination of probabilities a posteriori by adopting relative frequencies determined through observation as estimates of probabilities which could not be given a priori. He felt justified to proceed in this way by his fundamental theorem which at the same time served as the essential foundation of his program to extend the realm of application of numerically determinable probabilities.</p>
<p>Bernoulli's understanding of chance excluded events as occurring indeterminately. He was convinced that through a more precise knowledge of the parameters affecting the motion of a die, for instance, it would be possible to specify the result of the throw in advance. In similar fashion he viewed changes in weather as a determinate process, just as the occurrences of astronomical events are. Chance, in his view and later in the view of Laplace, was reduced to a subjective lack of information. Thus, depending on the state of their information, an event may be described by one person as chance, but by another as necessary. With this anticipation of Laplacian determinism Bernoulli appears to solve the problem of the connection between chance and divine Providence. The entire realm of events which are described in daily life as uncertain or contingent in their outcome is such, he claims, merely because of incomplete information: nevertheless, these too fall within the field of the concept of “probabilitas". Bernoulli's program to mathematize as much of this realm as possible with the aid of the classical measure of probability occupied researchers like de Moivre (q.v.) and Laplace (q.v.) throughout the 18th century and into the second half of the 19th.<br />

<p><b>Joseph Oscar IRWIN</b><br />
b. 17 December 1898 - d. 27 July 1982<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Oscar Irwin was the leading theoretician amongst British medical statistians and contributed especially to the use of statistical methods in biological assay and other fields of laboratory medicine.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>During the middle third of the 20th century, Oscar Irwin played an important role in linking theoretical statistics to applications in medicine. Amongst British statisticians he was unique in combining a deep understanding of current developments in mathematical statistics with a career commitment to medical research.</p>
<p>Irwin was born in London. After school, where he had specialised in classics and mathematics, Irwin was due to enter Cambridge University in 1917. His undergraduate career was delayed first by illness, and then by the remarkable opportunity to do wartime service with <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.) working on anti-aircraft trajectories. On achieving his degree in 1921 he was offered a post with Pearson on the staff at University College London. Renewed illness led to a period of recuperation in Switzerland, initiating a life-long love of that country and, in later life, marriage to a Swiss lady and a final move to Switzerland after retirement. He died in Schaffhausen.</p>
<p>In 1928 Irwin joined R.A. Fisher's (q.v.) department at Rothamsted Experimental Station. He was thus one of the few statisticians to work with both Karl Pearson and Fisher, and he was able to maintain cordial relations with both of these strong but disparate personalities. Fisher encouraged Irwin to read, and if necessary interpret, the theoretical papers he (Fisher) had published in the 1920's, and Fisher's powerful ideas provided a stimulus for Irwin's work throughout his career. Fisher always expressed a high opinion of Irwin's mathematical ability.</p>
<p>In 1931 Irwin joined the staff of the (British) Medical Research Council (MRC) in a small unit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where he was to stay for most the the next 30 years. His main responsibilities were in research, but for most of this period he taught an annual course in statistical methods for medical research workers, introducing topics such as analysis of variance that were relatively unfamiliar in this field of application. During the war years (1940-45) he worked in Cambridge, teaching statistics to mathematicians, many of whom pursued subsequent careers in statistics. Irwin returned to the MRC unit in London after the war, and retired in 1965.</p>
<p>Irwin's early work reveals great mathematical fluency, which he retained throughout his career. In Irwin (1927) he derived the distribution of the sample mean from various distributions using the characteristic function. At Rothamsted he wrote on various agricultural topics, but was stimulated by his close contact with Fisher into theoretical research on topics like the analysis of variance and the theory of interval estimation. In 1931 he started a series of papers, with bibliographies, on `Recent advances in mathematical statistics', which played an important role in spreading knowledge about theoretical statistics at a time when few relevant books existed.</p>
<p>His move to the MRC broadened his research interests. These included factor analysis in psychological testing, and theories of accident proneness, but otherwise his activities centered on laboratory experimentation. Most of this work was activated by collaboration with scientists whom he met on committees or who came to the unit for advice. There were papers on the estimation of bacterial populations, and most notably on biological assay and standardization (Irwin, 1937, 1950). An important contribution to statistical methodology was the `exact' <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">test</a> for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 2 \times 2$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/51/l2h/img1.png" title="$ 2 \times 2$" width="47" /></span> tables (Irwin, 1935), published independently from a paper by F. Yates and an account in a new edition of Fisher's <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i>.</p>
<p>After the war Irwin retained a position as the foremost adviser for the MRC on laboratory biostatistics, and he embarked on many long-term collaborative programmes, often for official committees. These included collaborative assays, nutritional studies, studies of physiological responses to hot climates, and laboratory tests for carcinogenicity of tars and mineral oils. In most of these projects he found scope for the investigation of theoretical problems; in the analysis of carcinogenicity experiments, for instance, he used actuarial methods that anticiapted some of the later work on censored survival data. Towards the end of his working career he became very interested in the Waring family of long-tailed discrete distributions, based on series of inverse factorials. Many of these topics were discussed in his Presidential Address to the Royal Statistical Society (Irwin, 1963).</p>
<p>Irwin participated actively in many professional societies, notably the International Statistical Institute, the Royal Statistical Society (President in 1962-64 and Editor of the <i>Journal, Series B</i> from 1949-59) and Biometric Society. In all, he published about 120 papers.</p>
<p>Irwin's role in medical statistics, concentrated as it was in the laboratory, tended to be overshadowed by the striking post-war developments in epidemiology and clinical trials. For this reason, and perhaps also lowing to a certain reserve in his personality, Irwin often seemed to be working behind the scenes rather than in the front of the stage. He was a fine expositor, particularly in his written work, and sought throughout his career to integrate the diverse strands of statistical theory and practice.<br />

<p><b>Irving FISHER</b><br />
b. 27 February 1867 - d. 29 April 1947<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> With his crusades for health, the League of Nations etc., Irving Fisher lost about half of his working time as professor of economics. Otherwise, his "pillars and arches", as Schumpeter called his contributions to theoretical economics, may have grown to a kind of temple of economics/econometrics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>When mathematical statisticians hear the name of Fisher, they think of Irving's namesake Ronald A. Fisher (q.v.). For economic statisticians it is clear that Irving Fisher is meant.</p>
<p>As with Ronald A., Irving Fisher is famous for introducing <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a> into statistics. A test in Irving Fisher's sense is a desired property of a price index. He introduced several tests into price index theory. His investigations in this field inspired many workers in this field till nowadays. Today, in the framework of axiomatic price index theory, it is well known which of the subsystems of Fisher's system of tests are consistent. Furthermore, finding a definitive axiom system for price indices accepted by all scientists concerned remains a field of research and debate (cf. Vogt and Barta 1997).</p>
<p>The following is a short synopsis of the life of Fisher. He was born in Saugerties, New York, USA. In 1884 he entered Yale University, where he earned his Ph.D in 1891, and was appointed as Assistant Professor of Mathematics in 1892. In 1893 he married Margaret Hazard and they spent the following year in Europe. He transferred from the Mathematics Department to the Political Economy Department at Yale in 1895 and was promoted to Full Professor in 1898. But he fell ill with tuberculosis and took leave for the following three years. He became President of the American Economic Association in 1918 and finally retired from Yale in 1935. He remained active until his 80th birthday and finally died, of cancer, on April 29, 1947.</p>
<p>At the age of 78, Fisher went to see the movie “Wilson" (about the former US President). He recorded in his diary a list of all the characters in the movie that he had known personally, practically a who's who of the epoch. In the same sense Fisher's Biography is a who's who of the worldwide economic science between 1891 when Fisher's thesis <i>Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Price</i> was published, and 1947 when he passed away. Fisher could be called the first econometrician. In fact, at the beginning of the century, he proposed to found such a society but - ahead of his time - he did not find followers. Finally, in 1930 he was involved in founding the Econometric Society. The group of 30 economists elected Fisher unanimously as their first president.</p>
<p>One scientific inspiration suddenly occured to Fisher on a mountain trip he made in Switzerland in July 1894 while looking at a watering trough, and its inflow and outflow: The basic distinction needed in order to distinguish capital and income was substantially the same as the distinction between the water in that trough and the flow into or out of it. That was the very moment when the distinction between flows and funds (i.e. stocks) was introduced in the economic science, a distinction which was traditionally made before by bookkeepers! However, Fisher mentioned that already Newcomb (q.v.) showed clearly the distinction between flows and funds.</p>
<p>Early in this century, Fisher played a seminal role in suggesting the use of double-entry bookkeeping techniques for national income and product estimates. He is even regarded as the intellectual organisor and founding father of all national economic accounting systems (Kenessey 1997). In 1913 Fisher founded the Life Extension Institute to endeavour to improve public health through publicity and by promoting periodic health examinations. He tried to convince insurance companies that it would be to their advantage to provide low-cost medical checkups. In 1916 Fisher was among the first to recognise the importance of insurance against large medical expenditures, coupling, as it does, his interest in maintaining and improving people's health with his interest in financial matters. He strongly favoured health insurance and foresaw the day when insurance would cover most medical costs.</p>
<p>In 1923 Fisher established his Index Number Institute, a business to prepare and sell index numbers and other economic data for publication. The Index Number Institute became the first organization to provide systematic economic data in index number form to the public, long before governments even began to think about it. By 1929 Fisher's wholesale price index reached 5 million newspaper readers.</p>
<p>Another contribution of Fisher to statistics was the investigation of distributed lags when determining the correlation between two time series. In a publication in <i>Extrait du Bulletin de ISI</i> of 1937 Fisher refered to several of his publications on the subject going back to 1925. Irving Fisher was also involved in the measurement of marginal utility. Fisher (1922:xiii) expressed his practical and theoretical ideas about index numbers:</p>
<blockquote>One incidental result of this study is to show that many precise and interesting relations or laws exist connecting the various magnitudes studied - index numbers, dispersions, ..., correlation coefficient, etc. Thus this field of study ... may truly be called an exact science - if it be permissible to designate as a science the theoretical foundations of a useful art.... Most writers on index numbers have been either exclusively theoretical or exclusively practical, and each of these two classes of writers has been very little acquainted with the other. By bringing these two worlds into closer contact I hope that, in some measure, I may have helped forward, both the science and the art of index numbers.</blockquote>
<p>Up to 1929 Fisher made a fortune of $10 million, mainly with one of his inventions, the index card system (and subsequent stock market gains). His firm producing it, later became Remington Rand Corp. After the stock market crash (October 1929), his fortune melted to about minus half a million going down further to nearly minus one million. Fisher's personal financial failure was a double burden for him as a great economist because he had recommended investment in stocks privately and in public. However, he remained an optimist throughout his life. After the crash he kept on seeing the economic recovery “round the corner". Already in December 1929 he had finished his book <i>The Stock Market Crash - and After?</i>.</p>
<p>Fisher was not a scientist living in an ivory tower but he enthusiastically tried to educate people. In an agreement with the Worker's Education Bureau, Fisher wrote simple explanations of elementary principles of economics suitable for reading by union members. He called them <i>Short Stories of Wealth</i>. The bureau issued them monthly for publication in any union publication that desired to print them. They appeared in the <i>Brotherhood of Locomotive Fireman and Engineers Magazine</i>, <i>Trade Union News</i>, <i>Labour Herald</i>, etc., and are currently on the way to being reprinted (Fisher 1998).</p>
<p>As Fisher was known for his scientific contributions in the world of economic science, he was known to the US public for his struggle for health (motivated by his own experience), prohibition and the League of Nations - for the betterment of mankind quite generally. His health book sold more than a million copies in 21 editions while Fisher was alive and then went on to 90 editions and 4 millions sold. It already promoted the idea of “biological living". With the quantity theory of money he made a cursade connected with his scientific work. Fisher was the first monetarist. A talk he gave on this subject can still be listened to (Fisher 1941).</p>
<p>Tobin writes that Fisher is widely regarded as the greatest economist America has ever produced. His main economic subjects were: theory of indices, theory of interest, theory of capital and income as well as taxation theory. He was prouder of his relatively unimportant book <i>The Money Illusion</i> (1928) than he was of <i>The Making of Index Numbers</i> (1922). He did not see that in the latter new contributions are building blocks that accumulate and form a long-lasting structure, whereas in policy matters, advocacy and even research are ephemeral.</p>
<p>Biographies of Fisher have been written by his son (I.N. Fisher 1956) and by Allen (1993). The former is a personal account. It records his father's publications in the different fields, 2000 altogether. The secret of Fisher's working power was best expressed by H. Cohrssen who worked from 1932 to 1942 for Fisher and died in Frankfurt in 1997 in a radio talk given at the occasion of Fisher's 80th birthday.</p>
<blockquote>It was in 1896 in a tuberculosis sanatorium, high in the Mountains of Arizona, where the air is pure and clear. A young man of 19 was sitting in his invalid-chair waiting for death. The doctors had given him only a very short time to live. Behind him were years of the most intensive work as an economist at a university and exceptional academic recognition. This man, marked by death, looked at his young wife, his child playing before him in the sand ... and he made up his mind: “I'd rather work to death than rust to death idly." He left the mountains and returned to his work.... He took up the battle against his sickness and packed into each and every day so much work that in the race against his death he might leave at least the maximum of creative work of which he was capable. Week after week, month after month, year after year this feverish race continued.... One book after another appeared, basic contributions to the science of economics, also notes recording his experiences in the field of health and hygiene which he made in quest for life extention.... He has been adviser to several presidents of USA; he was one of the founders of the Peace Society from which later developed the League of Nations.... Today he is 80. He is still tirelessly active and one of the happiest men I've ever met. His name is Irving Fisher, Professor of Yale University....</blockquote>
<p>In 1995 an Irving Fisher Committee was founded within ISI. In 1997 there appeared the first issue of the ifc Bulletin (cf. Fisher 1998).<br />

<p><b>Christiaan HUYGENS</b><br />
b. 14 April 1629 - d. 8 July 1695<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Trained to become a diplomat, a career which did not eventuate due to political circumstances, Christiaan Huygens turned to science and mathematics. While in Paris he heard of the Pascal's and Fermat's attempts to solve gaming problems. Back in Holland he conceived his calculus of expectations which considerably influenced the following generation of probabilists.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Christiaan Huygens was born in the Hague on April 14, 1629, the son of the diplomat, writer, and poet Constantijn Huygens whose Dutch and Latin verse gained him a lasting place in the history of Dutch literature. Because of its services to the house of Orange in two generations the Huygens family had risen to high social rank. Christiaan was educated by private tutors and his father before he went to Leiden in 1645 to study law and mathematics with the younger Frans van Schooten. He studied classical Greek mathematics and the new methods of Viète, Descartes, and Fermat (q.v.).</p>
<p>In March 1647 Christiaan Huygens matriculated at the Collegium Auriacum (Orange College) in Breda, again to study law. He also privately continued his studies of mathematics. After his return to the Hague in August 1649 he went to Denmark as a member of a diplomatic mission in the fall of 1649. However, after the death of the stadholder William II in 1650, Huygens had no chance to enter the diplomatic service for which he was prepared by his education.</p>
<p>The 17 years between the end of his studies in Breda and his departure to Paris in April 1666 which were spent in the Hague but with short visits to Paris and London were the most fertile of Huygens' career. He worked from 1650 to 1666 supported by an allowance supplied by his father, as a gentleman scientist, on problems of mathematics, mechanics, astronomy, the construction of pendulum clocks and of optical instruments, the lenses of which he ground himself. The discovery of the ring of Saturn in 1655/56 and the invention of the pendulum clock in 1656 made him famous and by the mid 60's he was considered the leading mathematician and natural philosopher of his time.</p>
<p>The following 14 years he spent in Paris at the Academy of Science. He continued his work in mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and technical problems and added to his interests fundamental questions concerning the cause of gravity and the nature of light.</p>
<p>The time in Paris was interrupted by several stays in the Hague where he tried to cure an illness which began in 1670. In 1672 the Netherlands were attacked by Louis XIV. William III, prince of Orange, was appointed Stadholder and Christiaan Huygens' father together with one of his sons played a considerable role in the defence against the French. One of the most urgent problems the Netherlands had to solve in this situation was to recruit soldiers for the military defence. The Radspensionaris of Holland, Jan de Witt, had worked out a financial arrangement, the Waerdye, according to which annuities on lives appeared as the most favourable means for the state to raise funds for this purpose. De Witt's expertise was based on the same principle as Huygens work on games of chance. Christiaan Huygens was informed of these activities but he seemingly felt no tensions concerning his loyalty. He not only remained in Paris but also dedicated his book on the mathematical theory of the pendulum clock, in 1673, to the French king.</p>
<p>When he again returned to the Hague in September 1681 because of his illness he decided not to return to Paris where the situation for protestants even from foreign countries had deteriorated. In the years until his death on July 8, 1695 he finished a series of works amongst which his <i>Traité de la lumière</i> published in 1690 and containing his theory of light and ideas about gravity, is perhaps the most famous.</p>
<p>Huygens' encounter with the world of stochastics took place quite early in his career. During his first stay in France in 1655 he had heard about letters exchanged in 1654 between Pascal (q.v.) and Fermat in which the two had discussed problems concerning games of chance. At that time Huygens neither met with Pascal or Fermat nor could he gather details about the methods used in the solution of these gambling problems. However, shortly after his return from France Huygens worked out a method to solve the problems based on his understanding of “expectation". From a conceptual point of view Huygens' “expectation" is different from “expectation" in later probability theory but both concepts yield the same values in the cases treated by Huygens. Huygens did not use the word probability in his solutions of chance problems. In his own understanding the method he applied for these solutions served only the purpose to demonstrate the power of the new algebra created by Viète and Descartes. The truth of Viète's statement that the new algebra leaves no sensible problem unsolved could now be demonstrated by Huygens' success to apply algebra to the realm of chance which hitherto seemed inaccessible for mathematics. When Huygens informed his former teacher Frans van Schooten of his work on games of chance van Schooten offered him space for a publication in his forthcoming book. So Huygens' tract <i>De ratiociniis in ludo aleae</i> came out 1657 in Leiden as an appendix to Frans van Schooten's <i>Exercitationum Mathematicarum Libri Quinque.</i></p>
<p>All the problems solved by Pascal, Fermat, and Huygens can be reduced to two problems, the problem of points and the problem of dice, both of which can be traced back at least to the late middle ages. The problem of points presupposes that a game is not decided by just one attempt of e.g. throwing a die but by a whole series of single attempts. In general the parties involved agree that the winner of the whole game and by that of all the stakes is the party which first won a certain number of single games. If the whole game cannot be finished for some reason and the parties have to leave before any of them has reached the necessary number of wins, the stakes have to be divided according to the number of wins the respective parties are lacking. Since the whole game can be interrupted at any time, those concerned with the solution of the problem of points began at least in the 14th century to investigate the new distribution of the stakes after each single game. So it became interesting to know how much of the opponent's stake would go to the side of the winner of a single game, be it the first, the second, and so on up to the last game.</p>
<p>The problem of dice was formulated in the mid-17th century as asking how many throws of a die are needed to get at least n aces. Huygens based the solution of these problems on the principle of a just game of chance. Participants engage in a game of chance because they hope for a gain and they know that they have to pay for this hope with the risk of a loss. A presupposition for justness is that the sum of the stakes is equal to the sum of the payoffs of the players, or, in other words, that there is no third party who takes a share of the stakes for his service to organize the game. Whatever game of chance is played, its end, that is to say, who won and who is entitled to the loser's stake is clear by unambigous rules which were valid centuries before Huygens. Huygens generalized the situation by admitting that the winner is entitled to a part of the loser's stake. This part can be less than the whole stake, but, of course, it must be positive. Huygens defined a just game with the postulate, that in gambling the expectation or share that somebody can claim for something is to be estimated as much as that with which, having it, he can arrive at the same expectation or share in a fair game. Huygens' fundamental principle contains the term expectation which is not explained explicitely. The expectation of a player A engaged in a game of chance in a certain situation is identified with his share of the stakes if the game is not played or not continued. If the game is not played or continued with player A who will be replaced by a player B, B has to refund A by an amount equal to the expectation of A in this situation in order to engage in a just game. Chance was considered by Huygens and his predecessors as a self evident term. Chance meant for them an unpredictable and hence uncertain event. In order to subjugate chance to mathematics it was necessary to select a class of these unpredictable events characterized by equipossibility which was considered by Huygens as something elementary and clear. As paradigms for equipossible cases were offered the outcomes of throwing a die, tossing a coin, participation in a lottery, or choosing between two hands hiding different amounts of money. The more complex problems were solved by reduction to equipossible cases. Huygens and his predecessors still lacked a problem which forced them to go beyond this. But a generation later, with <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=52" name="menu0">Jakob Bernoulli</a> (q.v.), new cases of unpredictability like dying in a certain age were taken into consideration which seemed to be neither equipossible nor reducible to equipossibility. For the successors of Huygens it began to matter that a more skilled and able player would win more frequently than his opponent in a series of games. Because equipossiblity had not become problematic to him frequency did not figure in Huygens' tract of 1657.</p>
<p>The first three propositions in Huygens' tract served for the determination of expectations in concrete situations. The first proposition is that if it is equally easy to obtain the amount <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/49/l2h/img1.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> or <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/49/l2h/img2.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> the value of the expectation is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (a + b)/2$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/49/l2h/img3.png" title="$ (a + b)/2$" width="79" /></span> , while the second proposition deals similarly with three equally likely amounts. Huygens' central proposition 3 says that if the number of cases for gaining <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/49/l2h/img4.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/49/l2h/img5.png" title="$ p$" width="14" /></span> , and the number of cases for gaining <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/49/l2h/img6.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ q$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/49/l2h/img7.png" title="$ q$" width="14" /></span> , then assuming that all cases can happen equally easily, the expectation is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (pa + qb)/(p + q)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/49/l2h/img8.png" title="$ (pa + qb)/(p + q)$" width="144" /></span> . The first three propositions show that there is no need for Huygens to revert to any notion of probability as available at the time in order to explain his understanding of expectation or his way to determine it. Instead Huygens felt a need to demonstrate the first three propositions of his tract in the most rigorous way.</p>
<p>In all three cases Huygens based his proof on a system of mutually symmetrical contracts between players. However, an analysis of the proofs of propositions 2 and 3 shows that they hold only if the very meaning of winning a game, and by that, common sense is given up. Huygen's proofs allow the possibility that the winner of a game between players who staked the same amount could go away with less than any of the losers.</p>
<p>Huygens was very much aware that some would accuse him of support with his tract for the frivolity of gaming, but he hoped that most of his readers would appreciate the utility of his work. Huygens uses the first three propositions to solve 11 problems in propositions 4 to 14. The first six problems deal with different situations of the problem of points presupposing equal chances for the players involved. Huygens' procedure for the solution of the problem of points involved establishing a difference equation for recursive calculation of expectations. Then, from the situation of equal chances Huygens proceeded to problems involving unequal chances for which his paradigm was the throwing of dice. Typical is the ninth problem (proposition 12): “To find how many dice should one take to throw two sixes at the first throw." Huygens added to the 14 propositions of his tract five problems the solutions of which he left to his readers. For the first, third and fifth of these problems which had been posed by Fermat and Pascal he gave the numerical results without the appropriate reasoning. This is the content of Huygens' tract from 1657 covering some 20 pages which came out again in the original Dutch wording in 1660. Because of its enormous impact on the following generation of mathematicians concerned with stochastic problems it has been called the first book on mathematical probability. However,it was neither a book - it was published as a short appendix to a book of Frans van Schooten - nor was it on probability since neither the word nor a concept of probability were used in the tract. Huygens' “theory" of games of chance was the intellectual game of a mathematician.</p>
<p>After 1657, Huygens repeatedly returned to problems of chance. In every case he was induced to these activities by others. He was eager to demonstrate that his method of calculating expectations by recursion sufficed to solve problems for which others used combinatorial methods. None of these later stochastic considerations was published; so his later work, had no impact on the following generations of mathematicians. When <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=44" name="menu1">John Graunt</a> (q.v.) brought out his <i>Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality</i> in 1662 a copy was sent to Christiaan Huygens. The <i>Observations</i> contained a very short life table and this was used by Christiaan to discuss with his brother Lodewijk in a correspondence from 1669 on the basis of his calculus of expectations in games of chance and the lottery model the difference of what is called today the expected and the median lifetime; in addition he approached the problem of joint-life expectations. The letters exchanged between the two brothers in 1669 would have been an important source of inspiration for all who dealt with mortality problems shortly afterwards but remained unknown until their publication in the Oeuvres in 1895. On the other hand Huygens' tract of 1657 was, relative to the small number of active mathematicians at the time, one of the most influential papers in the history of mathematics. In England Huygens' tract appeared in an English translation extended by the combinatorial methods propagated by Pascal in 1692. Jakob Bernoulli who transformed Huygens' concept of expectatation and used this to introduce the classical measure of probability reprinted Huygens' tract together with his annotations in the first book of his <i>Ars conjectandi</i> the first book centered around probability as the main concept of a new mathematical theory.<br />

<p><b>William John YOUDEN</b><br />
b. 12 April 1900 - d. 31 March 1971<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Beginning with the balanced incomplete block designs known as Youden Squares, W. J. Youden created many designs tailored to the needs of the physical and engineering sciences.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Jack Youden, the great communicator of statistical ideas and practicies in non-statistical terms, was born on April 12, 1900, in Townsville, Australia. He came to the U.S.A. at the age of seven and was trained as a chemist (Ph.D., Columbia University, 1924). A few years into his career, however, he became convinced that statistical methods are indispensable in all scientific work, for efficiency and validity. His contributions as a “missionary" for statistics in scientific research were so impressive that the statistical societies gave his name to three series of awards and prizes:</p>
<p>(i) The Youden Memorial Lecture, presented at the Annual Fall Technical Conference sponsored by the Section on Physical and Engineering Sciences of the American Statistical Association (ASA) and the Chemical and Process Industries Division and the Statistics Division of the American Society for Quality Control (ASQC).<br />
(ii) The Youden Prize, awarded by the ASQC for the best expository paper on statistical methods or philosophy that appeared in <i>Technometrics</i> during the previous year.<br />
(iii) The W.J. Youden Award in Interlaboratory Testing, given each year by the ASA.</p>
<p>Youden's contributions to statistical methods include innovative experiment designs, elegant procedures for displaying the results of interlaboratory comparisons of measurement and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">test</a> methods, and a stream of techniques tailored for use to improve the quality of scientific and engineering measurements. He was a pioneer in the application of twentieth-century Fisherian small-sample methods to the planning and analysis of experiments in the physical sciences. Following a brief outline of Youden's professional career, we describe a few highlights.</p>
<p>From 1924 to 1948 he was on the staff of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Yonkers, New York. In about 1928 he and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=120" name="menu1">Frank Wilcoxon</a> (q.v.) began using <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i> by R.A. Fisher (q.v.), and soon began contributing to statistical science. Youden took leave during the academic year 1937-38 to work with Fisher at the Galton Laboratory, University College, London. During 1942-45, he served as an operations analyst with the U.S. Army Air Corps.</p>
<p>From 1948 until his retirement in 1965, Youden was a senior staff member of the Applied Mathematics Division at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Washington, D.C.; he continued this affiliation as a Guest Researcher after his retirement. At the NBS, the U.S. national laboratory for physical measurement standards, Youden produced more experiment designs, developed interlaboratory testing procedures and his “ruggedness" test, wrote <i>Statistical Methods for Chemists</i> (Youden, 1951) and other books, and from 1954 through 1959 published 36 columns under the title “Statistical Design" in <i>Industrial and Engineering Chemistry</i>.</p>
<p>More complete biographical accounts are given in (Eisenhart and Rosenblatt, 1972), (Eisenhart, 1976), (Ku, 1978), (Cornell, 1992), and in a special issue of the <i>Journal of Quality Technology (JQT)</i> dedicated to Youden (Lasater, 1972). The <i>JQT</i> issue contains a nearly complete bibliography of Youden's publications, reprints of several of his papers and other materials, and a “Summary and Index for `Statistical Design'" compiled by Mary G. Natrella that describes his columns in <i>Industrial and Engineering Chemistry</i>. Eisenhart (1976) provides the definitive scholarly account and completes the bibliography.</p>
<p>Youden was often heard telling a “client" in consultation, or an audience at one of this well-attended lectures, that he was a “chemist", implying that he was really not a statistician. Nevertheless, while he may have been all chemist for his first few years at Boyce Thompson, the seed of his transformation to statistician was planted early when he obtained a copy of the first edition of Fisher's <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i>, and seized the opportunity to apply the methods in experiments in the field and in the greenhouse. Evidence of this began to appear in his publications in 1931.</p>
<p>The paper Youden (1937; reprinted in Lasater, 1972) was the first in which he introduced new experiment designs. The new class of rectangular designs, termed “Youden Squares" by Fisher and Yates in the first edition, 1938, of their book of tables, was found immediately to be of broad utility in biological and medical research generally, and to be of great value in scientific and engineering experimentation connected with research and development.</p>
<p>The description of Youden's work as operations analyst during World War II (Miser 1992) was entitled “Craft in Operations Research", but could as well be called “craft in applied statistics". Youden directed groups of civilian scientists seeking to understand and improve bombing accuracy, first in Britain and later in the Pacific area, and was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 1946. According to Miser, stories are legion among the members of the Operations Research Group of the Eight Bomber Command in England about Yourden's exceptional skills in the invention of novel, and adaption of standard, tools of experiment design and analysis, and his gifts in divining the best way (officially or unofficially) to get people to adopt his suggestions. Miser's account is summarized in a series of nine “lessons", for example, “When timely results are important, simple forms of analysis can be useful", and “It is worth a great deal to shape one's explanatory theory into a form in which it speaks clearly, easily, and forcefully to operational people". Youden's expository and persuasive skills are a recurrent theme in any account of his work.</p>
<p>In 1948, Youden accepted Churchill Eisenhart's invitation to join the newly established Statistical Engineering unit at the National Bureau of Standards. At the NBS, Youden was one of the first to recognize and to capitalize on important differences between experimentation in biological and agricultural sciences on the one hand and in the physical sciences on the other. Of paramount importance, he noted, is the difference in the magnitude of the error of measurement in the two areas.</p>
<p>Exploiting the precision of physical measurements, and responding to the challenges presented by practical aspects of experimental work, Youden developed several new kinds of designs. One group, “chain block designs", took advantage of special circumstances of spectographic determinations of chemical elements carried out by comparing spectrum lines recorded on photographic plates (Youden and Connor, 1953). Experiments involving pairs of measurements (blocks of size two) arose in the NBS thermometer, meter-bar, and radium-standards programs. This led to the development of “calibration designs" where only differences (or ratios) are observed for readings on two objects in blocks of size two (Youden and Connor, 1954). With J.S. Hunter, Youden developed “partially replicated Latin squares" to check whether the usual requirements for a Latin square design have been met (Youden and Hunter, 1955).</p>
<p>The high degree of precision with which physical scientists can repeat their measurements, with the same instrumentation set-up and within a short period of time, sometimes lures them into claiming an unwarranted confidence in their results and neglecting the vagaries of other components of error such as day-to-day variation, differences among nominally idential instruments and standards, and possible systematic errors that are not obvious <i>a priori</i>. Youden spared no effort in his lectures and writings to impress upon his audiences that a realistic estimate of experimental error could be obtained only through “hidden replication", that is, that a measure of precision should not be calculated from a series of straightforward repetitions, but from discrepancies between the measured values and the corresponding adjusted values derived under conditions specified by a careful design. In searching for unsuspected sources of systematic errors, he advised the experimenter, contrary to the time-honoured tradition of “varying one factor at a time", to a vary several factors at a time by proper planning, such that the effect of each factor can be measured with better precision than in the traditional way while using the same number of measurements (Youden, 1961). This 1961 paper introduced the “ruggedness test", for investigating the sensitivity of a method of measurement with respect to recognized sources of systematic error and changes of conditions likely to be encountered in practice.</p>
<p>By his publications and by his examples, Youden contributed significantly to the achievement of objectivity in experimentation and in the setting of more exacting standards for drawing scientific conclusions. His last major address, as retiring President of the Philosophical Society of Washington in 1968, was devoted to exposition of schemes for incorporating investigations of systematic errors into experimental determinations of fundamental physical constants. The plea for explicit efforts by scientists to accumulate objective evidence for the description of the precision and accuracy of their work was entitled “Enduring Values" (Youden, 1972).</p>
<p>A significant fraction of NBS work is related to the development and interlaboratory comparison of measurement and testing procedures. The “Youden plot" procedure was designed to provide simple but forceful interpretation of the results obtained in several laboratories ostensibly using the same test method (Youden, 1959; reprinted in Lasater, 1972).</p>
<p>Youden proposed that each laboratory make determinations on two specimens, chosen to have slightly different values of the quantity to be measured, avoiding the possibility that systematic differences between laboratories might be different at different magnitudes of the measurand (a phenomenon called “interaction" by statisticians). The Youden plot displays one point for each laboratory, the value for the first specimen plotted against that for the second. If the laboratories differ only because of small measurement errors, the points will fall within a roughly circular area. As is more often the case, however, the systematic differences between laboratories cause the points to spread out along a line with 45-degree slope so that laboratories that tend to obtain low values and those that tend to obtain high values are easily identified. This procedure is widely used in programs for proficiency testing of laboratories.</p>
<p>Youden had a talent for reducing a complicated idea to its essentials and then expressing the idea through simple language. He worked hard at it. He was highly successful in convincing his audience, specialists in other fields, of the reasonableness and usefulness of a statistical idea, omitting all unnecessary details, formulas, and statistical terms. For example, in his book for high school students, <i>Experimentation and Measurement</i> (Youden, 1962), the word “statistics" does not appear once! But the book is about the use of statistical design and analysis in physical experiments that can be performed readily by students.<br />

<p><b>Wilhelm WINKLER</b><br />
b. 29 June 1884 - d. 3 September 1984<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> As an organizer of statistics, and equally as a university teacher and social researcher, Winkler united theoretical and applied approaches to statistics. As a leading statistician of ethnic minorities in the time between the World Wars, he was also known as an advocate of the use of mathematical methods in the social sciences.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Personal background</b></p>
<p>Born in Prague, the fifth of eight children of a music teacher. Died in Vienna. He grew up in Prague, finished his studies at the <i>Humanistisches Gymnasium</i> (branch of secondary school) followed by the study of jurisprudence at the Karl-University in Prague, and joined the <i>Statistisches Landes-Bureau des KË†nigreiches Böhmen</i> (Statistical Bureau of Bohemia) as the sole German speaking statistician. Severely wounded in World War I as a highly decorated reserve officer, he was appointed in 1916 to serve in Vienna, with distinguished economists of the Austrian School of Economics, as a member of the Austro-Hungarian Scientific Committee on the War Economy. In 1919 he published “Casualties of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy", a detailed statistical study of the war losses of each ethnic group of this multi-ethnic state. In that year he also participated in the peace negotiations as the statistical advisor to the Austrian peace delegation in St. Germain. In 1920 he became second in command of the newly formed <i>Österreichisches Bundesamt für Statistik</i> (Austrian Federal Statistics Office). In 1925 he was appointed director of its department of population statistics. At that time he also began teaching at the University. In 1921 he became <i>Privat-Dozent</i> (Assistant Professor) at the juridical faculty of the University of Vienna. In 1929 he was promoted to the rank of <i>Ausserordentlicher Professor für Statistik</i> (equivalent to the status of an Associate Professor). W. Winkler then established the <i>Institut für Statistik der Minderheitsvölker</i> (Institute of Statistics of Ethnic Minorities) at the University of Vienna where he pursued research on the demographic and socio-economic structure of the widely scattered German-speaking populations in the succession states of the Habsburg Monarchy. At this Institute he produced a stream of research publications about the demographic, social and economic situation of these ethnic minorities in Europe. His research had an impact on the political struggle to find solutions for these minorities in the new European successor states after World War I.</p>
<p>W. Winkler also established contacts with the international statistical community. As a result, his work, especially his studies in statistical theory for the social sciences, became recognized beyond the German speaking realm. After his election as a member of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in 1926 he participated actively in most bi-annual congresses of the ISI, establishing a reputation as a strong advocate and debater in favor of mathematical formulations in statistics instead of the wordy and vague formulations that then prevailed in continental Europe.</p>
<p>The <i>Anschluss</i> of Austria to the German Third Reich in 1938 interrupted his career. He was dismissed as director of the population census, expelled from the University and banned from giving the invited lecture that had been scheduled for the ISI congress in Prague. The reason was his public opposition to Nazism and his marriage to a spouse of Jewish descent. In 1945, after seven years of severe deprivations, difficulties and the persecution of his family by the Nazi party, W. Winkler was rehabilitated and rewarded with the upgrading of Statistics as a fully recognized academic discipline, required for the study of economics, management and jurisprudence. He was appointed as the first Ordinarius of Statistics - the Full Professor - at the University of Vienna since 1883, when the last Full Professor of this field retired. In 1950/51 he was honored by election as Dean of the <i>Rechts- und Staatswissenschaftliche Facultät</i> of that University. He continued his efforts for the further improvement and recognition of Statistics in Austria as an academic discipline in its own right, and as a recognized field of study. He had to overcome the stiff resistance by the faculty who opposed statistics on philosophic grounds, opposition that today is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>After his retirement at age 71, in 1955, he continued working vigorously for the progress and recognition of statistics. As Vice President of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP) he organized the International Population Congress of 1959 in Vienna. In 1973 he was the driving force behind the ISI congress in Vienna. During his last years of life W. Winkler received numerous national and international honors in recognition of his role for the advancement of statistics. In 1952 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and in 1961 he became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society. In 1966 he was elected Honorary Member of ISI. He also received honorary doctorates from the Universities of Munich and Vienna.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Contributions to the development of statistics</b></p>
<p>Wilhelm Winkler's early interest in the statistics of ethnic minorities stemmed from his personal experience of the tensions between Czech and German population groups in Prague. His career as a statistician emerged from a background of the multiethnic and multilingual structure of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. In the 19th century the Austrian government, requiring extensive data on the different nationalities living in its empire, had to develop specific statistical methods to provide that information. W. Winkler began in that tradition. As a result of the disintegration of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1918, the rise of the succession states, and the decline of the German hegemony, he developed new concepts for the research of ethnic minorities, beyond the concepts then in use. He also developed new demographic methods, among them the matching of population- and economic census data with data from other statistical sources. The most important result of these studies was his “Statistical Handbook of the German Populations" financed by the <i>Stiftung für Deutsche Volks- und Kulturbodenforschung</i>, the leading organization for German <i>Volksforschung</i> in the Weimar Republic. The handbook used the new paradigm of statistics of ethnic minorities acknowledging the fact that ethnic groups often cross the borders of nations. W. Winkler can be regarded as one of the most influential demographers of his time, not only of Austria but also of the German speaking countries in general. Among German statisticians he was well-known for his efforts to introduce the mathematical methods, developed in the Anglo-American world, for socio-economic statistics, at a time when these new developments were hardly known on the European continent. It was his persistent, hard work of many years to convince his German colleagues of the need to open up academic statistics, as taught in the social sciences, to British and American developments in statistics.</p>
<p>The main concern of demographers in the period between the two World Wars was the assumption of a precipitous decline of births threatening the quantity and quality of the population, presaging a loss of power and influence of Europe, and of the German speaking population in particular. W.Winkler proposed to reverse these demographic trends through specific tax politics to encourage the formation of new families by taxing unmarried adults. His fertility index, based on the results of the Austrian population census of 1934, became the basis on which population politics was widely discussed in the late 1930s, though never acted on.</p>
<p>After World War II W. Winkler turned from his earlier research on ethnic minorities to intensify his efforts to develop and disseminate new methods in statistics. By publishing his works on Econometrics (1952) and on Demometrics (1969) he rejoined the international statistical discussion, although the backwardness of German and Austrian statistical research relative to the statistical advances in the West made it increasingly more difficult to contribute successfully to international debates.</p>
<p>W. Winkler was the leading government statistician and organizer of statistics as a science during the years of the First Republic of Austria (1925-1938), and after World War II ( 1945-1955). In that time he occupied the most important positions in statistics at the University and in Government in Austria. W. Winkler was the founder of the Austrian statistical Journal, <i>Statistische Vierteljahresschrift</i>, whose first volume appeared in 1948, and the Co-Editor of <i>Metrika</i>. He also founded the Austrian Statistical Society and created, praeter legem, a graduate program for statisticians from which the nucleus of the junior staff of Austrian and also some German statisticians emerged in the 1950s and 1960s.<br />

<p><b>Walter Frank Raphael WELDON</b><a href="#foot58" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a><br />
b. 15 March 1860 - d. 13 April 1906<br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Zoologist W.F.R. Weldon's efforts to make biology more rigorous and quantitative provided strong stimulus to K. Pearson, and through him the Biometric movement and the laying of the foundations of much of modern statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>W.F.R. Weldon, born in Highgate (London), was the second child of the journalist and industrial chemist, Walter Weldon and his wife Anne Cotton. His father changed residences so frequently that Weldon's early education was desultory until he became a boarder in 1873 at Caversham near Reading. Weldon matriculated at University College London (UCL) in the autumn of 1876 with the intention of pursuing a medical career. During his time at UCL, he acquired a respectable knowledge of mathematics from the Danish mathematician, Olaus Henrici, and attended the lectures of the zoologist, E. Ray Lankester.. In the following year he transferred to Kings College, London and on 6 April 1878, he entered St. John's College, Cambridge as a bye-term student.</p>
<p>Once at Cambridge, he met the zoologist, Francis Maitland Balfour, and subsequently gave up his medical studies for zoology. In 1881, he gained a first-class degree in the natural science Tripos: in the autumn he left for the Naples Zoological Station to begin the first of his studies in marine biological organisms. Upon returning to Cambridge in 1882, he was appointed university lecturer in Invertebrate Morphology, and in the following year he married Florence Tebb. He became a founding member of the Marine Biological Station in Plymouth in 1884 and resided there until 1887. From 1887 until his death in 1906, Weldon's work was centred around the development of a fuller understanding of marine biological phenomena and, in particular, the examination of the relationship between various organs of crabs and shrimps to determine selective death rates in relation to the laws of growth. During his first five years at the Marine Biological Station, Weldon's investigations were directed to the study of classification, morphology and the development of Decapod crustacea. His only work on invertebrate morphology contained an account of the early stage of segmentation and the building of the layers of shrimp. Weldon was both a master of histological techniques and a powerful and accurate draughtsman. In 1889 he succeeded E. Ray Lankester in the Joddrell Chair of Zoology at University College London.</p>
<p>During this time Weldon read <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=38" name="menu0">Francis Galton</a>'s <i>Natural Inheritance</i>. In this book Galton (q.v.) had shown that the frequency distributions of the average size of certain organs in man, plants and in moths were normally distributed. Similar investigations had been pursued by the Belgian statistician, <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=88" name="menu1">Adolphe Quetelet</a> (q.v.), whose work was confined to “civilised man". Weldon was interested in investigating the variations in organs in a species living in a wild state which acted upon natural selection and other destructive influences.</p>
<p>When Galton was writing on heredity in 1889, he had predicted that selection would not change the shape of the normal distribution; he expected that his frequency distributions would remain normally distributed in all cases whether or not animals were under the action of natural selection. Around this time, Weldon began to study the variation of four organs in the common shrimp (Crangon vulgaris) and he collected five samples from waters fairly distant from Plymouth. His statistical analysis which he published in 1890, confirmed Galton's prediction. Shortly after the paper was published, Weldon was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>
<p>During the Easter vacation of 1892, Weldon and his wife collected 23 measurements from 1000 adult female shore crabs (Carcinus mœnas) from Malta and the Bay of Naples. Weldon discovered that all but one of the 23 characters he measured in the Naples group were normally distributed; he found that this one character (the frontal breadth of the carapace) was instead a `double-humped' (i.e., bi-modal) curve. His first attempt to interpret the data involved breaking up the curve into two normal distributions as Galton had advocated. Weldon then approached <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu2" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu2">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.) (who had been appointed as Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mathematics at UCL in 1884) for assistance with interpreting his data. At that time, Pearson was teaching applied mathematics to engineering students at UCL and was also giving his Gresham lectures of Geometry at Gresham College. (This ancient educational foundation, located in the City of London, offered lectures to members of the public on an annual basis.)</p>
<p>By the end of 1892 Pearson began to devise a probability system of curve fitting for Weldon's data, and he used this material in his Gresham lectures in the following year. From his analysis of Weldon's data, Pearson concluded that two separate species had arisen. Up until the middle of the nineteenth century species were defined in terms of types or essences. Charles Darwin's recognition that species comprised different sets of `statistical' populations rather than types or essences, prompted a reconceptualization of statistical populations by Pearson and Weldon. Moreover, this required the use of new statistical methods. Following Pearson's work on curve fitting of asymmetrical distributions, in his Gresham lecture of 23 November 1893, he devised a goodness of fit <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu3" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu3">test</a> for asymmetrical distributions for Weldon's data. These statistical innovations formed much of the basis of Pearson's work in the nineteenth century, and in 1900 Pearson devised the chi-square <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ ({\chi}^2 , P)$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/127/l2h/img1.png" title="$ ({\chi}^2 , P)$" width="62" /></span> goodness of fit test (his single most important contributions to modern statistical theory). When Pearson was working out the mathematical properties of simple correlation and regression in 1896, Weldon suggested to Pearson the idea of a negative correlation. (Galton had used positive correlations only.) Pearson regarded Weldon as `one of the closest friends he ever had'. Their relationship could be characterised by an emotional and intellectual intimacy that engendered a symbiotic alliance. It is thus not surprising that one of the most extensive sets of letters in Pearson's archives are those of Weldon and his wife Florence, which consist of nearly 1,000 pieces of correspondence.</p>
<p>Though not a statistician by training, it was Weldon's interest in finding statistical tools to demonstrate empirical evidence of Darwin's theory of natural selection in marine organisms that provided the impetus to Pearson's development of the modern theory of statistics. Weldon also provided Pearson with the basis of a programme that underpinned the construction of his statistical innovations in the 1890s which, in turn, provided the infrastructure for Pearson's statistical developments in the twentieth century. Weldon's influence, which exceeded that of any other person in the emergence and development of Pearsonian statistics, arose from the following factors: he provided the stimulus for new statistical methods by asking Pearson biological and statistical questions that could be answered only by devising a new statistical approach, he offered continual moral support as well as encouragement; and he promulgated the Pearsonian corpus of statistics to `serious students of animal evolution' throughout the 1890s and until his death in 1906. Though some of the statistical work of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu5" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=123" name="menu5">John Venn</a> (q.v.) and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu4" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=27" name="menu4">Francis Ysidro Edgeworth</a> (q.v.) played a role in Pearson's early work on probability, there seems to have been no other person whose influence on the emergence and development of Pearsonian statistics was as rapid and immediate in its impact as that of Weldon.</p>
<p>When Weldon went up to Oxford in 1899, to take up the Linacre Chair of Comparative Anatomy, he carried on the biometric tradition by gathering a number of students who began to look for empirical evidence of natural selection acting upon various animals and plants. Despite Weldon's move, he and Pearson made arrangements to be together every year during the Easter and Christmas vacations and throughout the summer months. They continued their collaborative work investigating biometrical problems such as natural selection, inheritance and, in particular, Mendelian inheritance. These joint biometrical projects were pursued until Weldon's untimely death in Oxford in 1906. Weldon's death was for Pearson the single greatest loss in his life.<br />

<p><b>Walter Francis WILLCOX</b><br />
b. 22 March 1861 - d. 29 October 1964<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Willcox, demographer and statistician, founded the statistical research office in the U.S. Census Office, and was a major innovator in demographic analysis and apportionment theory and methodology in the United States.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Walter F. Willcox was born in Reading, Massachusetts, and received Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Amherst College in 1884 and 1888. He went on to attend Columbia University and he continued his studies in Germany in the late 1880s. There he encountered statistical methods and ideas, and shifted his earlier interests in law and philosophy to data-inspired empirical social research. He received a PhD from Columbia University in 1891 after completing a thesis on divorce (published as <i>The Divorce Problem: A Study in Statistics</i>, (Studies in History, Economics and Public Law, New York: Columbia University Press: 1897).</p>
<p>Willcox took a position as Professor of Economics and Statistics at Cornell in 1891, served as dean from 1902 to 1907, and remained at Cornell until he retired to emeritus status in 1931. His major contributions to statistics were in the realm of demography, apportionment methodology, and the development of the federal statistical system. From 1899 to 1902 he served as Chief Statistician for the Twelfth Census of the United States and in that capacity encouraged the hiring of PhD trained statisticians to the positions of special agents in charge of the technical development of censustaking. Those appointees included Allyn Young, Wesley Mitchell, Joseph Hill, Carroll Doten, William Rossiter, Warren Persons, E. Dana Durand, all of whom served as Presidents of the American Statistical Association in later years. During his tenure at the Census Bureau, he encouraged the production and publication of special analytic reports on census methods and census results. These were published as <i>Supplementary Analysis and Derivative Tables: Twelfth Census of the United States</i> (Washington, GPO, 1906) and provided the prototype for the development in to the Census Monograph Series. Willcox himself continued his relationship with the Census Bureau after returning to Cornell in 1902; he served as a special agent from 1902 on. He was President of the American Statistical Association in 1912, the American Economic Association in 1915, and a long time member of the ASA-AEA Census Advisory Committee which began after World War I. He was elected President of the International Statistical Institute in 1947.</p>
<p>As a founding father of the field of demography (and the Population Association of America) in the United States, Willcox encouraged the development of data on birth, fertility, marriage and divorce, mortality, migration and population composition. He developed methods of analysis, including a ratio of children under five to women of childbearing age which could be use to calculate fertility rates in the absence of birth registration data. And he had a long term interest in congressional apportionment methodology, advocating the method of major fractions from the turn of the century on. Willcox played a major role in the controversies over the census apportionment method in the 1920s, when Congress refused to reapportion itself because it could not sort out the conflicting criticisms of the quality of the 1920 census, two conflicting formulas for apportionment, and the changing demography - particularly urbanization - of the United States. Willcox testified before Congress while in his nineties on these issues, remaining extremely critical of Congress' choice of the method of equal proportion over his method of major fractions. Though he had participated in the development of the legislative compromise that ended the Congressional stalemate over apportionment methods in the late 1920s, he remained critical of the failure of Congress to support equal districting within the states as well as equal apportionment among the states. He was also a lone voice in the wilderness deploring the increasing malapportionment of Congress in the first half of the twentieth century, and was 101 when the United States Supreme Court rectified the situation with the “one person, one vote" decision of 1962. Willcox died in 1964.<br />

<p><b>Siméon-Denis POISSON</b><br />
b. 21 June 1781, d. 25 April 1840<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b> Poisson, the apostle of Laplacian science, was the master of French mathematics from 1815 to 1840. His contribution to probability theory is not confined to the distribution which bears his name or to the expression “Law of Large Numbers", but bears on various areas ranging from pure mathematics to the mathematics of artillery.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Siméon-Denis Poisson who was born in Pithiviers and died in Sceaux, came from a modest background. His father, who had been a soldier, held a minor administrative post and became president of the Pithiviers district (Loiret) during the French Revolution. As a child, Siméon-Denis was first educated within his family, and later in the <i>école centrale</i> at Fontainebleau, one of the secondary schools created by the Directoire between 1795 and 1799. He owed his social and scientific rise to the new scientific institutions such as the Institut de France, the École Polytechnique, and the Bureau des Longitudes, created by the French Revolution, as well as the unconditional and very effective support of Laplace (q.v.), his mentor in all things.</p>
<p>Poisson was admitted as the top candidate to the École Polytechnique in 1798. Singled out by his teachers, he was appointed as Associate Professor in 1802, and Professor in 1806 to replace Fourier who had been named Prefect. In 1809, he was the first Professor of Mechanics in the new Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris, which Napoleon had just created. He became an astronomer at the Bureau des Longitudes in 1808, and a member of the Institut de France in 1812. In short, Poisson gathered all the possible laurels available under the new French academic nomenclature. At the fall of the Emperor Napoleon in 1815, Poisson, whose political flexibility was as remarkable as the rigidity of his scientific convictions, was given supreme powers over the French universities. For 25 years, he was to reign without sharing of power over scientific education at all levels. It was he alone who decided on the appointment of Professors at every scientific institution, large or small, and he determined their teaching programs in the minutest detail. One can well imagine that this concentration of power earned him many enemies. Nevertheless, his administrative achievement was considerable, and devoted entirely to the service of a cause: the development and use of Laplacian science, of which he was the main heir after his mentor's death in 1827.</p>
<p>Poisson's scientific achievement is impressive both in its quantity and quality: it covers all of the physics and mathematical analysis of the period. Poisson was a very thorough analyst who solved problems by direct attack on the most complex and delicate of points. We may mention his work on the differential equations of mechanics, which are at the very basis of the fundamental researches of Hamilton and Jacobi 30 years later and also his work on domains of attraction which inspired the most beautiful discoveries of Green. One could equally well single out his work on the various “definite integrals" with which he toyed. Poisson is remembered in history more for his mathematical virtuosity than for his corpuscular physical models. These were the cause of many of his controversies, for example with Laplace on capillarity, with Fourier on heat, with Fresnel on light and with Navier on elasticity. According to P. Costabel, his strength lay rather in his “sense of formalism, which uncovers analogies, unifies problems or areas which have so far been distinct, and extends decisively the use of the calculus."</p>
<p>The clarity of his exposition, whether oral or written, was such that his teachings encapsulated in his <i>Traité de Mecanique</i> (1st edition 1811) served as a basic text during the 19th century.</p>
<p>Together with Fourier, Poisson was among the first to understand the fundamental importance of Laplace's probabilistic opus. It was Poisson who gave the first convincing if not definitive proofs of Chapter 4 of the second volume of the <i>Théorie analytique</i> of 1812 containing “Laplace's Theorem". This states that the sum of a large number of errors having any distributions is asymptotically Gaussian, whence “Laplace's formula" allows us to calculate the parameters of the limiting distribution to good precision from the observations alone. Poisson, who helped to create the first chair in the Calculus of Probabilities for his friend Libri in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris, was also the first to teach Laplace's formulae in his lectures at the Sorbonne in 1836. These lectures, later published as a large 415 page book in 1837, served as a model for the teaching of the asymptotic theory of probabilities throughout Europe, particularly in Berlin, Cambridge and St Petersburg. The title <i>Recherches sur la probabilité des jugements</i> of this treatise is misleading. Only the last quarter of the volume is concerned with judgements; the rest of the work is a complete treatise on probability, in which several important theoretical concepts are to be found, at least between the lines and without specific announcements. Among them are those of random variable and distribution function (p.140).</p>
<p>Poisson's interest in the calculus of probabilities was probably evoked by the abstracts (comptes rendus) of Laplace's and Fourier's papers, which he prepared for the <i>Bulletin de la Société Philomatique</i>, dating from 1808-1810. His first publication on probabilities discusses the banker's advantage in the game of “trente et quarante" which was very popular in 1820; in it he adapts some Laplacian ideas on characteristic functions. A short time after, he studies certain noteworthy Fourier transforms, such as that of the Cauchy distribution. Poisson was thus one of the first to consider a theory of errors where the error distribution was not necessarily Gaussian (Normal).</p>
<p>Poisson lived through the extraordinary development of statistics in the first half of the 19th century. In every one of the positions which he held, he tried to demonstrate how Laplacian theory could be used to validate statistical data. It was he who introduced Laplacian theory into the probabilistic problems of target practice. In his articles in the <i>Mémorial de l'Artillerie</i> of 1829, he defined the problem of dispersion of shots in a probabilistic setting, where these shots follow what we would now refer to as a bivariate Gaussian distribution. This was the starting point of the remarkable and unacknowledged works of French artillery men of the 19th century, trained at the École Polytechnique and the École d'Application d'Artillerie et du Génie in Metz, such as I. Didion, G. Piobert, or E. Jouffret. These works foreshadow many aspects of modern mathematical statistics.</p>
<p>Poisson's name remains best known for the most famous scientific metaphor in the history of statistics, namely the “Law of Large Numbers", which he published in 1835. This was to become the main inspirational source for Quetelet (q.v.), and later of the so-called Continental School of statistics. By the Law of Large Numbers, Poisson meant that the proportion of successes in independent trials shows statistical regularity even if the probability of success in each trial is not the same. This version of the Law has come to be known more specifically as Poisson's Law of Large Numbers, being a generalization of the famous Law of J. Bernoulli (q.v.). It explained theoretically the fact that descriptive statistics in the moral sciences had been observed in the 1830's to display numerical regularity, but gave rise to many memorable controversies, particularly in the decade following 1830, not only at the Academy of Sciences but also in the Chamber of Deputies. The more general question in dispute was the relevance of the calculus of probabilities, or even more simply “quantitative methods" in medicine (with Louis, Gavarret, etc.) as well as in criminology and demography. Poisson's Law was, in particular, unjustly attacked by Bienaymé (q.v.) after Poisson had devoted the last hundred pages of his famous work of 1837 to it, extending the work of Condorcet (q.v.).</p>
<p>As for the Poisson distribution, it may be found highlighted in his treatise of 1837, but he himself would have been very surprised to learn that in probability theory he was to be remembered in our time almost entirely for this single minor contribution, especially since the distribution itself had already been found by de Moivre (q.v.). It was mainly around 1900, following the researches of Bortkiewicz (q.v.), Erlang (q.v.), Bateman and others, that the Poisson distribution acquired a renewed practical significance. It is particularly prominent in connection with the “Poisson process". Of course, Poisson's name is attached to a number of concepts outside of probability. To mention two: Dirac has acknowledged “Poisson brackets", and students of analysis continue to learn about "Poisson's integral". Thus Poisson may well rest in peace.<br />

<p><b>John VENN</b><br />
b. 4 August 1834 - d. 4 April 1923<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Venn is remembered largely for his writings on logic and his compilation of data on alumni of Cambridge University, but he also wrote a widely read text-book on probability theory.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>John Venn was born in Hull, England, in 1834, a son of a prominent divine. He spent his entire career not only in one university but even one college, Gonville and Caius, Cambridge. He is most generally remembered as an historian of his college (of which he was President from 1903 until his death 20 years later), and also aas a chronicler of all the graduates of the university in his <i>Alumni Cantabrigienses</i> (1922-1954), a multi-volume work which was continued after his death by his son. He was very active in the reform of the Moral Science Tripos in the 1870s, and for many years he taught the elementary logic course.</p>
<p>Partly in this connection, Venn wrote influential textbooks. The first one, entitled <i>The Logic of Chance</i> and dealing with probability theory, appeared in three editions between 1866 and 1888. He rehearsed many features and practical applications of the theory, such as insurance, gambling and the appraisal of testimony, although he deliberately eschewed most mathematical details. Following R.L. Ellis (1817-1859), he adopted a frequentist interpretation of probability, regarding as visciously circular the assumption that we know which causes pertain to the effect under study; only long runs could make them manifest in the first place. Thus he rejected the view that statistical regularities could be explained by causal mechanisms.</p>
<p>Venn applied his position to the St. Petersburg paradox, arguing that the player faced with the joy of possibly infinite winnings should appraise his requested investment in terms of an `average gain' over some <i>finite</i> run of offers of reward. He also criticized the estimation of random processes such as the births of boys and girls as a function only of the occurrence of each event; he asserted that the distribution of births in it families was sought, and presented data on British families with 4,5 or 6 children.</p>
<p>Venn saw probability theory as a branch or offshoot of logic; for example in `modality' where propositions such as `it is probable that all <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ X$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/123/l2h/img1.png" title="$ X$" width="22" /></span> is <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Y$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/123/l2h/img2.png" title="$ Y$" width="20" /></span> ' is used in reasoning. He expanded his lecture course on logic in his book <i>Symbolic Logic</i> (1888, 1894) (the origin of that phrase, incidentally). He largely followed Boole's ideas on the algebra of logic, with modifications to the interpretation of some notations. His adherance to Boole made him rather passé in the development of algebraic logic (for example, he did not appreciate the innovation of a logic of relations by De Morgan); but his book remains a rich and valuable source of information. One of its virtues are the many historical references, for which he drew on his own extensive library (now kept in the Cambridge University Library).</p>
<p>Venn als introduced a diagrammatic representation of syllogisms; but the name `Venn diagram' is a misnomer in that it normally designates the representation introduced a century earlier by Euler, as Venn well knew. His own diagrams used convex figures to represent each predicate in a given case, drawn such that all possible intersections were illustrated; then empty subclasses were shaded in. This kind of representation is more general but more clumsy than Euler's and convex shapes can only work for four predicates. Venn sought means for extending the diagrams for more predicates; a systematic and general method was published in 1989 by his Caius successor A.W.F. Edwards.</p>
<p>In <i>The Principles of Empirical or Inductive Logic</i> (1889, 1907), Venn treated logic within the syllogistic tradition. Following a practice of logic books of the 19th century later, he included applications which we might construe as philosophy of science; for example causation, classification, and the uniformity of nature. He comes over as a disaffected Millian, especially with his cautious views of causation.<br />

<p><b>Johann Peter SÜSSMILCH</b><br />
b. 3 September 1707 - d. 22 March 1767<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Pastor Süssmilch was the German ancestor of demographic statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The life and career of Johann Peter Süssmilch, minister of St. Peter's church in Berlin-Kölln, were closely related to religious currents in Prussia during the 18th century. A churchman of strict evangelical allegiance, he rose in the hierarchy of the Lutheran church, while at the same time developing his scientific opus as a demographic statistician. He has gradually acquired an international reputation which is well deserved. One may well ask to what an extent he was a representative of the “Aufklärung" (Enlightenment), and how much his researches were inspired by his faith as a man of God.</p>
<p>Süssmilch was born in Zehlendorf near Berlin. His father Elias Süssmilch had travelled in France, England, the Netherlands and most of the German states; he spoke several living languages, but having become a brewer, he devoted himself to his business. It was his maternal grandfather Peter Blell, who probably played the most important role in the development of the future author of <i>Die göttliche Ordnung (The Divine Order)</i>. Süssmilch spent his earliest years in Brandenburg-am-Havel, with his grandfather, who gave him the rudiments of education and enrolled him in the Neustädtische Gymnasium directed by the pietist <a href="#foot42" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a>Caspar Gottschling, who was very close to August Hermann Francke, the inspirer of the pietist movement.</p>
<p>In 1716, Süssmilch studied at the “Grey Cloister" Gymnasium in Berlin; one of his teachers was the co-rector Johann Leonhard Frisch, philologist, naturalist, member of the Academy of Sciences, correspondent of Leibniz and disciple of Philipp Jacob Spener, founder of Berlin pietism. In an autobiographical sketch which appeared shortly before his death, Süssmilch thanked Frisch for awakening his interest in the observation of nature, as a manifestation of God's works. These two forms of knowledge, knowledge of the Creator, and knowledge of his creatures remained indissolubly connected in the works of the minister.</p>
<p>Süssmilch was attracted by medicine, and attended the Theatrum Anatomicum, reorganized by Friedrich-Wilhelm I; he successfully passed an examination in osteology in 1724. But his parents preferred law, and were rather discouraging about their son's medical vocation, so that he gave it up; nevertheless, his work bears the traces of this “repression" of his natural interests. Medicine was replaced by another passion: for it was at this stage that Süssmilch met the Berlin minister Michael Roloff, his first mentor in theology.</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctant to study law, Süssmilch left for Halle, a centre of pietism, in 1727. He became personally involved with Francke, pursued theological studies and made up his deficiency in oriental languages, particularly Hebrew. His education continued in Jena: Süssmilch familiarized himself with Wolffian philosophy, and defended a thesis on the cohesion of physical bodies under the direction of the medical doctor Georg Erhard Hamberger.</p>
<p>Although his time in Jena was of great importance in his scientific development, Süssmilch did not abandon the pietist influences of his childhood and of Halle. From 1728 to 1730, the future minister frequented a community of Herrnhüter <a href="#foot43" id="tex2html2" name="tex2html2"><sup><span class="arabic">2</span></sup></a>, and became involved in teaching and evangelising the poor. It was because of his ties with the pietist circle that he became, through Roloff, the tutor of one of Marshal Christoph von Kalckstein's sons, the Marshal being a familiar of the Court.</p>
<p>After this appointment, Süssmilch's career was secure. In 1736, he became chaplain to the von Kalckstein regiment; it was he who preached the last sermon attended by the dying Friedrich-Wilhelm I. He was appointed to the parish of Etzin, took part in the first Silesian war, and in 1742, against the wishes of Friedrich II who had finally rallied to the evangelical cause, became Pastor Primarius of St. Peter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1741, Süssmilch had published the first version of his major work <i>Die göttliche Ordnung in den Veränderungen des menschlichen Geschlechts, aus der Geburt, Tod, und Fortpflanzung desselben erwiesen (The Divine Order in the Changes of the Human Species, as Demonstrated by its Birth, Death and Propagation)</i>.</p>
<p>In this work, Süssmilch declared himself explicitly a follower of English physico-theology, more specifically of William Derham, the author of <i>Physico-Theology</i> (1713). The entire training and development of Süssmilch effectively led him to uphold the traditional argument on Divine Providence, and the incontestability of the Divine Word as revealed by Scripture. He sought to demonstrate through a careful examination of empirical data, that the laws governing humanity were as formal and undeniable as those of Newtonian mechanics. Thus, three major currents of thought of 18th century Europe combined in the minister's work: Lutheran faith coloured by pietism, Anglo-Dutch physio-theology born of Newtonian philosophy and demographic statistics. Süssmilch was fully aware of his predecessors in statistical research, and his concerns were never far removed from those of the “political arithmeticians". But he was not an innovator; rather he was a compiler. The publication of <i>Die göttliche Ordnung</i> resulted in the author's election to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. He contributed regularly to the activities of this learned society. The Memoirs which he read there, some of which were published, revealed his three interests: history, linguistics and demographic statistics. For Süssmilch, it was clear that these three areas of knowledge sprang from a single idea: God ruled over the world through the hand of His Providence.</p>
<p>The minister indulged in some polemics, launched into some business deals such as the Berlin-Potsdam-Berlin stagecoach, and a plantation of mulberry trees in Friedrichshagen, and he became a censor. Armed with his numerical data, of which he could never have enough, he tried to act as a private councillor to Friedrich II on questions of population. This was vain, for the king ignored his “reprimands" and Süssmilch had to content himself with ecclesiastical preferment, first becoming inspector of parishes, then <i>Konsistorialrat</i> <a href="#foot48" id="tex2html3" name="tex2html3"><sup><span class="arabic">3</span></sup></a>.</p>
<p>But the statistician in him never lost sight of his magnum opus. He continued to collect data and gathered his academic contributions to publish, 20 years after its first edition, a corrected and considerably augmented second edition of <i>Die göttliche Ordnung</i> in 1761-62. This work is a vast compendium of demographic data, socio-economic analyses, and polemics against the great thinkers of the day, among them Montesquieu. While maintaining the essence of his fundamental theses, this rich compilation, even more than his youthful work, can be thought of as the illustration of the divine commandment: Increase and Multiply. For Süssmilch the peopling of the earth was one of the realisations of the Divine Goal for man, God's privileged creature. The minister had himself contributed to this goal with his wife Charlotte Dorothea Lieberkühn, whom he had married in 1737, by fathering 10 children, of whom 9 survived, a remarkable feat for that period.</p>
<p>The last published work of Süssmilch in 1766 (he died within a year) was the important <i>Versuch eines Beweises, dass die erste Sprache ihren Ursprung nicht vom Menschen, sondern allein vom Schöpfer erhalten habe. (Essay on the Proof that the First Language did not Originate with Man, but with God Alone)</i>. Three years before, the minister had suffered a stroke and was half paralyzed. A third edition of <i>Die göttliche Ordnung</i> similar to the second had been published in 1765. Eleven years later, in 1776, Süssmilch's nephew by marriage, Christian Jacob Baumann, published the book again, with a number of “additions and complements" in which he made use of the minister's data in a somewhat idiosyncratic fashion.</p>
<p>While he never made any discoveries in the area of statistical method, Süssmilch, by bringing together the most extensive set of available data of his time, was known in his lifetime to German speaking Europeans, and in particular recognized by the Dutchman Struyck and the Swede Wargentin, both important figures in the history of demographic statistics. <i>Die göttliche Ordnung</i> of 1761-62, translated into Dutch in 1770, discussed in England, tolerably well known and respected in Germany, where Süssmilch may be justly regarded as the father of demographic statistics, was translated in part and published in France by Jacqueline Hecht of the Institut National d'Études Démographiques (INED) in 1978. The appearance in 1998 of an annotated edition with commentaries of this opus princeps of 1741, extends her effort, so essential to the history of demography and statistics, of which Süssmilch was undoubtedly one of the main founders.<br />

<p><b>George Udny YULE</b><br />
b. 18 February 1871 - d. 26 June 1951<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Yule's coefficient of association, Yule's paradox (later called Simpson's paradox) and the Yule process all perpetuate the name of a pioneer statistician who also contributed to Mendelian theory and time-series analysis.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>George Udny Yule was born in Beech Hill, near Haddington, Scotland. He came from an old-established family of army officers, civil servants and orientalists. Both his father and his uncle had been knighted. He was educated at Winchester College from where, at the age of only 16, he transferred to University College, London, to study engineering. <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.), then Professor of Applied Mathematics, was beginning to develop his own interest in statistics, and in 1892 offered Yule a post as demonstrator. In 1896 Yule was appointed Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics, a post he held for three years until he resigned it in favour of more remunerative employment.</p>
<p>His continuing interest in statistics, however, led to his appointment as Newmarch Lecturer in Statistics at University College in 1902, a post which he held concurrently with his other work until 1909 and which led to the publication of the book which made his name, <i>An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics</i>. The first edition appeared in 1911 [4] and during his lifetime there were thirteen further editions. The eleventh edition was the first to be jointly undertaken with M.G. Kendall [7], and by the time of the fourteenth and last edition of Yule and Kendall, 1950, Kendall's own two-volume <i>The Advanced Theory of Statistics</i> was already establishing itself. It, and its present-day descendants, still bear the marks of Yule's pioneering effort.</p>
<p>In 1912 a Lectureship in Statistics was established for Yule by the University of Cambridge, to be held in the Faculty of Agriculture, and this, coupled with a Fellowship at St John's College from 1922, provided him with congenial employment (save for the war years) until 1931 when he retired, by then Reader in Statistics. At that stage he bought an aeroplane and learnt to fly. He kept up his College teaching until the second war, and died in Cambridge in 1951.</p>
<p>A major topic of Yule's early statistical work was pauperism, and he concentrated on the way administrative reforms reduced observed rates. He distanced himself from standard eugenic interpretations.</p>
<p>Yule played an important part in the affairs of the Royal Statistical Society, of which he was honorary secretary for twelve years and subsequently President (1924-26). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1922.</p>
<p>Yule's main contributions in the theoretical field were concerned with regression and correlation, association in contingency tables, Mendelian genetics, epidemiology and time series. In the Pearsonian fields of regression and correlation he gave more prominence than his mentor to the former, perhaps easing the path towards R.A. Fisher's (q.v.) invention of the analysis of variance.</p>
<p>Yule's studies of the correlation of continuous variables led him, in 1900 [1], to study measures of association for discrete variables, in particular the cross-ratio <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ c$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/121/l2h/img1.png" title="$ c$" width="13" /></span> (“odds ratio") in a <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 2\times2$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/121/l2h/img2.png" title="$ 2\times2$" width="47" /></span> contingency table and its transform <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ Q = (1-c)/(1+c)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/121/l2h/img3.png" title="$ Q = (1-c)/(1+c)$" width="164" /></span> , now known as “Yule's coefficient". This led to an altercation with Pearson in which Pearson's capacity for acrimonious and ill-directed criticism was displayed, in marked contrast to Yule's gentler mode of expression. Even Fisher, who as a young man had also felt the sharpness of Pearson's pen, was later moved to remark “Pearson attacked Yule's work at one time much more violently than ever he did mine". In 1903 [3] Yule, making use of his understanding of partial correlation, described what was much later to be termed “Simpson's paradox", in which the pairwise associations at two levels in a <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 2\times2\times2$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/121/l2h/img4.png" title="$ 2\times2\times2$" width="79" /></span> table can be seemingly incompatible with the marginal association. In his work on association, all his numerical examples were drawn from biology.</p>
<p>In Mendelian genetics, Yule [2] was the pioneer in suggesting that the observed correlations between parent and offspring could be accounted for by multifactorial Mendelian inheritance, as Fisher fully acknowledged in his classic treatment of the correlation between relatives in 1918. In 1914, in collaboration with F.L. Engledow, Yule invented the method of minimum <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \chi^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/121/l2h/img5.png" title="$ \chi^2$" width="24" /></span> for estimating a genetic recombination fraction, and the following year, with M. Greenwood, he was the first to recognize that there was something wrong with Pearson's <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \chi^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/121/l2h/img6.png" title="$ \chi^2$" width="24" /></span> <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">test</a> of association in respect of the degrees of freedom used, as Fisher was later to prove. He introduced the simple birth process of stochastic theory (the “Yule process") in connection with evolution in 1924 [5]. He also introduced the correlogram of a time series and laid the foundations of the theory of autoregressive processes. His name is remembered in the “Yule-Walker equations" which provide least squares estimators of the parameters of an autoregressive process.</p>
<p>F. Yates ended his Royal Society obituary notice of Yule with</p>
<blockquote>“We may ... justly conclude that although Yule did not fully develop any completely new branches of statistical theory, he took the first steps in many directions which were later to prove fruitful lines for further progress. ... In the biological field ... his work provided a corrective to many of the errors committed by the biometric school, and served to spread the use of statistical methods amongst biologists who might otherwise have been wholly repelled by them. He can indeed rightly claim to be one of the pioneers of modern statistics".</blockquote>

<p><b>Frank WILCOXON</b><br />
b. 2 September 1892 - d. 18 November 1965<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Wilcoxon was a notable chemist and had a significant role in developing modern insecticides. He and Jack Youden were two of a three person study group meeting to study R. A. Fisher's newly published book, <i>Design of Experiments</i>. Both became statisticians and made important contributions.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The first edition of <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i> by R. A. Fisher (q.v.), later Sir Ronald Fisher, was published in 1925 and received much attention in the experimental sciences. Some time late in 1925 or early 1926, a physical chemist, Frank Wilcoxon, a chemical engineer, William John (Jack) Youden (q.v.), and a biologist, F. E. Denny were the nucleus of a group that met regularly at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Yonkers, N. Y. to study Fisher's statistical methods.</p>
<p>This introduction to statistics had a profound effect on the careers of Wilcoxon and Youden. Both became leading statisticians of their time, statisticians with the clear goal of devising and using statistical methodology to improve research, particularly in chemistry and the physical sciences. Both Wilcoxon and Youden were early leaders in the annual, week-long Gordon Research Conference on Statistics in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.</p>
<p>The object of this article is to record highlights of the life and contributions of Frank Wilcoxon. In this, we have relied heavily on earlier writings, Bradley and Hollander (1978) and Bradley (1966).<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Early Years</b></p>
<p>Frank Wilcoxon's parents were wealthy, married young, toured Europe on an extended honeymoon, and rented Glengarriffe Castle near Cork, Ireland for the expected birth of their first child. Frank and a twin sister were born on September 2, 1892. Their father was a poet, outdoorsman, and hunter, the family home being at Catskill, N.Y. on the banks of the Hudson River. Frank developed a lasting love for nature and the water but was never a hunter or fisherman.</p>
<p>Frank's early instruction was by private tutors. He signed on as a crew member on a freighter in New York harbor at age 16 or so, but after a week of chipping paint when the ship failed to sail, he jumped ship. Thinking that he had committed an offense comparable to desertion from the navy, he fled to a deserted area of West Virginia where he spent several years manning an oil-well pump and later climbing trees as a tree surgeon. Hearing of a school in Boston providing training in forestry, he proceeded to that city only to find the school closed. He returned home. This led to his enrolment in the Pennsylvania Military College from which he graduated in 1917. The school's military system was not to his liking; early manhood was a difficult period in Wilcoxon's life. Also, at about this time, his sister died in child birth, a serious loss to him and an influence in his own decision not to have a family.</p>
<p>After a World War I position with the Atlas Powder Company in Houghton, Michigan, Wilcoxon enrolled at Rutgers University in 1920 and completed the M.S. degree in chemistry in 1921. He then transferred to Cornell University and completed the Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry in 1924, staying on as a postdoctoral Heckscher Fellow in 1924-25. At Cornell, Frank met Frederica Facius, an undergraduate at Cornell and they were married on May 27, 1926. Frank and Freddie became well known and loved in the statistical community through their regular participation in the Gordon Research Conference cited above. On leaving Cornell, Wilcoxon took a postdoctoral fellowship sponsored by the Nichols Copper Company at the Crop Protection Institute located at the Boyce Thompson Institute in Yonkers, N.Y., thus being present to participate in the study group.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Career Positions</b></p>
<p>Frank Wilcoxon was employed by the Nichols Copper Company in Maspeth in Queens from 1928 to 1929, then returning to Boyce Thompson as a group leader of an investigation of the actions of insecticides and fungicides under a grant from the Hermann Frasch Foundation. Wilcoxon stayed at the Institute until World War II when he took leave for two years in charge of the control laboratory of the Ravenna Ordnance Plant operated by the Atlas Powder Company in Ohio. (Wilcoxon was quite proud of his work with Atlas in both world wars, particularly in avoiding accidents in areas under his control.) Frank took a position as group leader of the insecticide and fungicide laboratory of the American Cyanamid Company in Stamford, Connecticut in 1943. In his later years at Boyce Thompson and his earlier ones at Cyanamid, his interest, study, and knowledge of statistics grew. In 1950 he transferred to the Lederle Laboratories Division of Cyanamid and developed a statistical consulting group. Wilcoxon retired in 1957, took on a part-time consulting assignment at Boyce Thompson, and was persuaded in 1960 by the present author to take on a half-time, teaching and research position as Distiguished Lecturer in the one-year old Department of Statistics at Florida State University in Tallahassee, where he continued until his death on November 18, 1965.</p>
<p>Frank had two periods in which he engaged in teaching. From 1929 to 1941, although holding full-time jobs, he taught physical chemistry in evening classes to graduate students at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. From 1960 to his death, he taught courses in applied statistics in the newly formed Department of Statistics to natural science majors at the Florida State University. The courses that he developed had real life examples, often based on his own research or consulting experiences, that his students appreciated. They were less pleased that he gave no credit in grading for any problem with an incorrect numerical answer regardless of the technical sophistication of techniques used. He reasoned that incorrect numerical work was totally unacceptable in a research project and his students accepted this. Frank Wilcoxon found teaching to be rewarding and stimulating; he was loved by his students and some formed long-term associations with him.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Wilcoxon's Research</b></p>
<p>Two brief events illustrate the high regard held for Frank Wilcoxon's research in both statistics and chemistry.</p>
<p>A joint meeting of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the Eastern North American Region of the Biometric Society was held in Chapel Hill, N.C. in April, 1962 [See <i>Annals of Mathematical Statistics</i>. <b>38</b>, 1220-1223, 1962] . Possibly for the first time, Wilcoxon gave an invited address, the topic being, two-sample, sequential, rank <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a> [Wilcoxon, Rhodes and Bradley (1963) ]. He received a prolonged standing ovation.</p>
<p>The second event was related to a meeting of the Board of Control (now Board of Regents) of the Florida state universities in 1961. The Florida State University Department of Statistics was seeking the approval of the Board for a Ph.D. program in statistics. The President of the university asked the present author to be present at the meeting in case questions arose. When the agenda item was addressed and the Board was asked for comments, a member of the Board commented “I see that Frank Wilcoxon is associated with this proposal and any program with Frank Wilcoxon is good enough for me." The comment was made by a citrus grower familiar with Wilcoxon's role in the development of the insecticide malathion. The proposal was approved without further discussion.</p>
<p>Karas and Savage (1967) list 80 Wilcoxon articles including several revisions of his well known (1947) pamphlet, <i>Some Rapid Approximate Statistical Procedures</i>, 22 of which dealt with statistical procedures or use of statistics in applications. Wilcoxon's statistical work indeed focused on rapid easy statistical methods; he was interested in ranking methods [See his famous paper, Wilcoxon (1945), in which he introduced both the rank-sum and signed ranks tests.], tabling, individual comparisons by ranking methods, nomograms, and methods of dose and time response. He came to the Florida State University with an array of research topics that he had not had time to address in industry and a number of us had the opportunity of working with him on these topics. The FSU research included sequential, two-sample, grouped rank tests, extended tables of significant levels for his 1945 rank tests, and rank-sum distributions in the two-way classification. He motivated other FSU research on sequential signed rank tests and multivariate two-sample nonparametric tests. He also worked with Cuthbert Daniel on factorial treatment combinations robust against linear and quadratic trends.</p>
<p>As often happens, independent proposals for the rank-sum test were later found, some before 1945 [See Kruskal (1957)], but it was Wilcoxon's work that stimulated a burst of research on ranking procedures. We do not discuss Wicoxon's publications in chemistry but they do relate closely to his training and early work assignments noted above. Major areas of his research relate to fungicides, fumigants, and insecticides, with investigations of their actions, effects and toxicities. McCallan, S. E. A. (1966) reports on Wilcoxon's ressearch in chemistry. Other references are provided by Bradley and Hollander (1978) along with a Wilcoxon bibliography on statistics.<br />

<p><b>Francis Amasa WALKER</b><br />
b. 2 July 1840 - d. 5 January 1897<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Walker, United States Civil War general and President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, contributed to statistics through service1 as Director of the U.S. Census Office and president of the American Statistical Association.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Francis A. Walker (1840-97) made significant contributions in advancing the discipline of statistics during his relatively short life. Walker was born into a prominent Massachusetts family, graduated from Amherst College in 1860, and like many of his generation, entered the military at 21 to fight in the Civil War. He left the military in 1865 as an Adjutant General. In later life, he became a major Gilded Age intellectual. He became Superintendent of the Census in 1869 at the age of 29; was appointed President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1881; and served as President of the American Statistical Association from 1883-97. His contributions to the field of statistics derive from his positions as Census Superintendent, ASA President, and public intellectual.</p>
<p>Walker entered federal service in the Treasury Department in early 1969 as plans for the 1870 census were being developed. He prepared a report for Congress on reforming census legislation; Congress rejected the legislation. He was formally appointed Superintendent in January 1870, and oversaw the field enumeration and data processing and publications for the 1870 count. A temporary Census Office housed in the Department of Interior took the decennial census. Walker oversaw the work of about 6,500 enumerators and 400 officer workers who collected and tabulated (by hand) population, agriculture, mortality and manufacturing data on 39 million Americans. He published five main volumes of census results and a statistical atlas, and disbanded the office, as required, in 1873. His main accomplishments of running an efficient operation in 1870 made it possible for the census reform legislation, which had failed in Congress in 1869-70, to be passed in the late 1870s. Walker returned to direct the 1880 count. In that year, the American population topped 50 million. Walker made significant changes in field enumeration methods. He enlarged the scope of inquiries, instituted civil service examinations for office staff, expanded the publications of the census to 22 volumes, and quadrupled the size of the clerical staff to 1500 people. The enumerator force grew to over 31,000 to speed the field operations portion of the count. He also made numerous less dramatic changes in organization. Walker became only the second census superintendent in the U.S. history to oversee more than one decennial count, and only one in three in the 200 year history of the census.</p>
<p>He left the Superintendency in 1881 and never returned to federal office. But he did continue to have a significant advisory role to federal statistical officials. In particular, he recognized that the growing size of the American population, and the concomitant growth in the demand for data, made hand tabulation increasingly problematic. He encouraged the system of machine tabulation developed by Herman Hollerith - which was put in place for the 1890 census. That system became the foundation of IBM.</p>
<p>Walker's second major role was as president of the American Statistical Association. He took over the position in 1883 at Edward Jarvis' death and continued in the position until his death in 1897. He oversaw the development of ASA from a small Boston learned society of less than 75 members, to a national professional association with a respected journal, and national meetings. Walker hired and charged a young instructor at M.I.T., Davis R. Dewey, to undertake the tasks of what he called “expanding the influence of the statistical association." The <i>Journal of the American Statistical Association</i>, then called the <i>Publications</i> of ASA, began in 1888; membership grew to around 500 at his death in early 1897.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s, Walker also remained an influential economic and social writer and observer. As the first President of the American Economic Association, he played a major role in the development of modern economics in the United States. He contributed a plethora of books and articles on demography, political economy, immigration, and social policy. Nevertheless, from the perspective of the late twentieth century, some of his work is marred by the increasingly strident nativism which gripped the writings of late nineteenth century elite intellectuals. He became the intellectural founder of the immigration restriction movement in the United States, publicizing the supposed racial differences between old and new immigrants - and proclaiming the decided inferiority of the new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. These “beaten men from beaten races," he claimed, were lowering the American standard of living and threatened the future of the polity. Much of his thought was taken up by a later generation of intellectuals and written into the now discredited National Origins Act of 1924, which ended the three century American committment to unfettered immigration.</p>
<p>Walker died rather suddenly at the age of 56, just days after giving the address opening the first meeting of ASA outside Boston -in Washington, DC in December 1896. That meeting led to the founding of the Washington Statistical Society. His achievements in developing major federal data systems, in promoting the organizational development of statistics, and of bringing statistical ideas to a wide audience, left the field much the richer than he found it -and prepared for the great innovations in inferential statistics which were about to transform the discipline.<br />

<p><b>Adrien-Marie LEGENDRE</b><br />
b. 18 September 1752 - d. 9 January 1833<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> In 1805, Legendre published the first description of the method of least squares as an algebraic fitting procedure. It was subsequently justified on statistical grounds by Gauss and Laplace.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Adrien-Marie Legendre was born in Paris (France). He was the son of well-to-do parents and could afford to devote himself full-time to scientific research until the rigours of the French Revolution dissipated the family fortunes and made it necessary for him to work for a living as a minor official in a variety of administrative posts.</p>
<p>The French Revolution began in May 1789, King Louis XVI was executed in January 1793 and Queen Marie-Antoinette in October 1793. the subsequent Reign of Terror hastened the deaths of many scientists including those of Antoine Lavoisier and the Marquis de Condorcet (q.v.). It is fortunate for the development of science in France that Fourier, Laplace (q.v.), and Legendre amongst others were able to escape with their lives.</p>
<p>Following the completion of the Revolution in France, the French government, latterly under the control of Napoléon Bonaparte, fought a series of wars which drew in most of the countries of Europe. Thus it was in the year of the battles of Austerlitz and Jena, that Legendre, then 52 years old, published his monograph outlining the fundamental results on the method of least squares.</p>
<p>Legendre was educated at the <i>Collège Mazarin</i>, graduating in 1770. Between 1775 and 1780 he taught mathematics at the <i>École Militaire</i>.</p>
<p>The geodetic work published by Legendre during this period was so important that it merited four chapters in Todhunter's <i>History of Mathematical Theories of Attraction and the Figure of the Earth (1873)</i>. Thus, when in 1787, the <i>Académie des Sciences</i> was asked to nominate three members of a commission to connect the maps of Britain and France by determining the relationship between the meridians of Greenwich and Paris, it chose Legendre, Méchain, and J.D.Cassini. In 1791 the <i>Académie</i> again nominated the same individuals as its members of a commission to determine the length of the <i>mètre</i> which was to form the basis of a new decimal system of mensuration. However, Legendre resigned from the second commission in March 1792.</p>
<p>In 1799 Laplace became Minister of the Interior and Legendre succeeded him as the examiner in mathematics of students assigned to the artillery corps. In 1815 Legendre voluntarily resigned this position on half pay but was subsequently stripped of his pension when he refused to vote for the official candidate in an election to a seat in the <i>Institut de France</i>.</p>
<p>Legendre died in Paris in 1833.</p>
<p>In the second half of the eighteenth century astronomers, geodesists, and other practical scientists were obliged to perfect their own methods for solving systems of equations in which there were more observations than unknowns. From antiquity until 1750 the only possible solution to this problem was to arrange that there should be as many equations as there were unknowns. In 1750 Tobias Mayer suggested that the unknowns should be determined by setting certain sums of equations equal to zero; in 1760 Boscovich (q.v.) proposed that the unknowns should be determined by minimising the sum of the absolute errors subject to an adding-up constraint; and in 1786 Laplace suggested that the unknowns should be determined by minimising the largest absolute error. Legendre's method of least squares clearly represents a further contribution in this practical tradition as his argument is entirely algebraic and has no statistical content.</p>
<p>Legendre's discussion of the method of least squares is to be found in the first four pages (pp.72-75) of a nine-page appendix attached to his 1805 work on the determination of the orbits of comets. The remaining five pages of this appendix are concerned with an application of the method of least squares to the determination of the ellipticity of the Earth, and hence the length of the <i>mètre</i>.</p>
<p>By contrast with the Boscovich and minimax procedures which, in practice, seem to have been restricted to the case of two unknowns, the method proposed by Legendre could be applied to any number of linear equations in any lesser number of unknowns. Instead of choosing values for the unknowns to minimise the largest absolute error or to minimise the sum of the absolute errors, he chose these values to minimise the sum of the squared errors. Legendre wrote down the first order conditions for the minimisation of this function. He then noted that each of these conditions may be obtained by multiplying all the terms in each of the equations by the coefficient of one of the unknowns and summing the result. He was thus able to establish that there were the same number of equations as there were unknowns, and hence that the first order conditions could be solved for the unknowns by a standard procedure which he did not describe.</p>
<p>Legendre asserted that the solution found by this procedure corresponds to a minimum of the sum of squares function . But he did not prove this result except in the special case when there is an exact fit and the least squares values of the unknowns are associated with a set of zero errors. Further, if the least squares solution produces any large errors then Legendre suggested that the corresponding observations should be discarded and new least squares values computed by deleting the corresponding terms from the calculations. This statement presumably represents an extension of current practice to the method of least squares. The problem of deciding when an error is large enough to warrant deletion was not discussed. Legendre gave very little justification for choosing the sum of the squared errors as his optimality criterion other than its computational simplicity. However he did note that it yields the arithmetic mean when there are a set of direct observations on a single unknown quantity. Subsequently, in the nonstatistical section of his <i>Theoria Motus Corporum Coelestium (1809)</i>, Gauss (q.v.) essentially reproduced Legendre's deliberations but offering the sum of the fourth powers, the sum of the sixth powers, etc as possible alternatives to the sum of the squared errors. Of these criteria, the simplest is indeed the sum of the squared errors, which Gauss says he had used in practical calculations since 1795, much to the annoyance of Legendre who published a venomous response in 1820.</p>
<p>The method of least squares would seem to have been hanging in the air at this time as there are several claimants for the privilege of having first invented it including Gauss, Cotes, Simpson, and Huber. Most of these claims can be rejected as having been made with the benefit of hindsight and in ignorance of the difficulty that eighteenth century mathematicians would have experienced in conceiving of minimising a sum of <i>squared</i> errors rather than a sum of absolute errors. However, the claim for priority made by Gauss at the time would seem to have been substantiated in the opinion of Laplace, Plackett (1972), Stigler (1977, 1981, 1986), and other authorities, but Legendre retains the priority of publication, for what that is worth. Further, Gauss's practical fitting procedure was designed for use with nonlinear problems and its precise nature is still open to question, again see Stigler (1981) for details.</p>
<p>As noted above, Legendre's derivation of the method of least squares was entirely algebraic; statistical justifications for this fitting procedure were subsequently provided by Gauss, Laplace, Cauchy (q.v.), and Thiele (q.v.) amongst others.</p>
<p>Legendre's system of orthogonal polynomials have also found applications in statistics.<br />

<p><b>Harold HOTELLING</b><br />
b. 29 September 1895 - d. 26 December 1973<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> A major developer of the foundations of statistics and an important contributor to mathematical economics, Hotelling introduced the multivariate <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ T^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img1.png" title="$ T^2$" width="26" /></span> , principal components analysis, and canomical correlations.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Harold Hotelling was born in Fulda, Minnesota, USA. He graduated with a B.A. in Journalism in 1919, and subsequently obtained a Master of Science degree in mathematics in 1921, both from the University of Washington. In 1924, he received his doctorate in mathematics from Princeton University, writing a dissertation on topology. Upon leaving Princeton, he joined the Food Research Institute at Stanford University where he was a research associate from 1924 to 1927, and an associate professor in the Department of Mathematics from 1927 to 1931. It was during this time that Hotelling, already involved in economics and mathematics research, began his work in statistics. He became aware of the writings of R. A. Fisher (q.v.) and began a correspondence with him that led to their long friendship. In fact, Hotelling wrote in 1927 the book review of the first edition of Fisher's <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i> for <i>The Journal of the American Statistical Association</i>, and also spent a number of months visiting Fisher at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in the second half of 1929. While at Stanford, Hotelling wrote several ground-breaking papers in both statistics and mathematical economics. Hotelling developed his generalization of Student's <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img2.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -ratio to deal with multivariate correlated response data (Hotelling, 1931) and this <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">test</a> known as Hotelling's <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ T^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img3.png" title="$ T^2$" width="26" /></span> , remains one of his best known results. Also he worked with Holbrook Working, and together in 1929 they developed results on the standard error of the estimated regression line leading to the well known Working-Hotelling curved simultaneous confidence regions for a regression line. In addition to his statistical research at Stanford, Hotelling worked in mathematical economics. Of the notable papers he wrote, one in 1929 dealt with a problem of optimizing price and location in a competition between two entities in a spatial setting. The other paper in 1931 dealt with exhaustible natural resources, in which he showed that in equilibrium, the prices of such natural resources will have a tendency to rise over time at a percentage rate that equals the national interest rate.</p>
<p>In 1931, Hotelling was recruited to Columbia University to be a professor of economics, and also to undertake the initiation of mathematical statistics at Columbia. On July 1, 1942, Hotelling, W. Allen Wallis and Jacob Wolfowitz became the charter members of the renowned Statistical Research Group (SRG) which was based at Columbia University during World War II and remained in existence until September 30, 1945. (See Wallis (1980) for details concerning the SRG.) The SRG attracted an extraordinary group of research statisticians to Columbia, and its goal was to support the Armed Forces in improving the quality and efficency of their war efforts. As part of the SRG effort, Hotelling developed methods for control charts for multivariate data (Hotelling, 1947), and Abraham Wald did his fundamental research establishing the field of sequential analysis.</p>
<p>During his career at Columbia University prior to the War, Hotelling continued with his innovative developments in statistics and mathematical economics. He introduced the idea of principal component analysis in his 1933 and 1936 papers as a way of understanding the structure of large numbers of correlated multivariate observations, and he generalized the notions of correlation and multiple correlation to introduce canonical correlation analysis which allows one to measure the strength of relationship between two dependent sets of multivariate observations, and also understand the structure of the relationships between them (Hotelling, 1936). In 1940, he wrote with great foresight a paper on how statistics should be best taught in universities. Hotelling (1940) anticipated the growth of statistics and, at that time, innovatively argued that the subject of statistics should be taught in universities by statisticians in departments of statistics. In mathematical economics, two notable papers of this period were one in 1935 uniting demand and utility and one in 1938 introducing the “welfare equilibrium principle.”</p>
<p>Hotelling was president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1941, having been one of the three original founding leaders of the Institute in 1935. He also served as president of the Econometrics Society in 1936-37, and was actively involved with the Cowles Commission essentially from its beginning.</p>
<p>One year after the end of the World War II, Hotelling was recruited in 1946 to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to start upon his arrival a Department of Mathematical Statistics. This department was to be a complement to the Department of Experimental Statistics at North Carolina State University at Raleigh, and together the two departments plus groups in social sciences, sociology, and biostatistics were to constitute an Institute of Statistics. Hotelling remained chairman at Chapel Hill until 1952 and formally retired in 1966; however, aftewards he continued to remain active in the department. At North Carolina, he continued his research, publishing papers in 1947 and 1951 on hypothesis tests related to multivariate analysis of variance, and introduced the criteria which continues to be referred to as the Lawley-Hotelling trace.</p>
<p>At both Columbia University and at the University of North Carolina, Hotelling excelled at attracting outstanding colleagues. Hotelling was intimately involved in bringing Abraham Wald to Columbia, as well as helping to attract Jacob Wolfowitz and W. Allen Wallis. At Chapel Hill such renowned statisticians as R. C. Bose, Wassily Hoeffding, P. L. Hsu, William Madow, Herbert Robbins, and S. N. Roy, were drawn there by Hotelling. He also was successful at developing young researchers who later would be renowned in their careers. He was an early mentor of both Milton Friedman and Kenneth Arrow, both of whom were later to win the Nobel Prize in Economics.</p>
<p>Hotelling's best known statistical contributions in multivariate analysis remain vital and current to present times. These specifically include Hotelling's <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ T^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img4.png" title="$ T^2$" width="26" /></span> , principal components, and a number of correlational techniques.</p>
<p>Although introduced in 1908, Student's <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img5.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -test remains as one of the most used statistical procedures for univariate data. Hotelling (1931) had recognized that experiments often have multiple measurements on each individual, and thus multiple univariate <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img6.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -tests would be correlated. Hotelling's elegant solution was to propose a vector formulation of Student's test which yields a quadratic form whose distribution under the null hypothesis is that of an <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ F$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img7.png" title="$ F$" width="19" /></span> -distribution. In particular, he showed that the general distribution of the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ T^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img8.png" title="$ T^2$" width="26" /></span> does not depend on nuisance parameters, but only on a quadratic form in the population mean vector, in which the matrix of the quadratic form is the inverse of the population covariance matrix. In showing this, Hotelling made use of invariance, thereby anticipating a theory developed much later. The multivariate version of Student's <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img9.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -statistic remains known as Hotelling's <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ T^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img10.png" title="$ T^2$" width="26" /></span> statistic.</p>
<p>To untangle the correlation and variability that exist among multiple measurements <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x_1 , \ldots x_q$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img11.png" title="$ x_1 , \ldots x_q$" width="74" /></span> on an individual, Hotelling (1933) introduced principal components. Principal components are uncorrelated linear combinations of the original measurements, each successfully decreasing in variation, and yet in total preserving the variation of the original measurements. Hotelling showed that the theoretical solution to the principal component problem involved finding the characteristic roots of a population covariance matrix. This then naturally led to the study of the distribution of the roots of the sample covariance matrix and thereby opened a new research area of statistics involving roots of determinantal equations. Because characteristic roots of a covariance matrix were not readily computed numerically at that time, Hotelling suggested a power method which had the effect of accentuating the largest and smallest roots. This procedure was adopted for sometime by numerical analysts until more effective factorization methods were later developed.</p>
<p>Beginning with his early research, Hotelling was interested in relations between variables. His first publication in 1925 dealt with the distribution of correlation ratios. In 1936, he introduced the concept of canonical correlations. To handle relationships between two sets of multiple measurements on an individual, he extended the multiple correlation coefficient which had been previously introduced to study the correlation between a single variable <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ y$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img12.png" title="$ y$" width="15" /></span> and multiple measures <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x_1 , \ldots , x_q$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img13.png" title="$ x_1 , \ldots , x_q$" width="83" /></span> . The first canonical correlation between measures <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ y_1 , \ldots , y_p$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img14.png" title="$ y_1 , \ldots , y_p$" width="80" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x_1 , \ldots , x_q$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img15.png" title="$ x_1 , \ldots , x_q$" width="83" /></span> is the maximum correlation between separate normalized linear combinations of the x's and the y's. Subsequent canonical correlations are similarly defined, but constrained to be uncorrelated of earlier chosen canonical variates.</p>
<p>In data analysis, the first canonical variate provides what might be termed “the most predictable criterion,” which was studied by Hotelling in 1935 in the context of educational psychology. In 1936, Hotelling, jointly with Margaret Pabst, studied rank correlations, and in 1953 presented a Royal Statistical Society paper on correlations and their transforms. This paper remains as one of the definitive papers that discusses properties of correlation and Fisher's <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ z$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img16.png" title="$ z$" width="14" /></span> -transformation on Fisher's <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ z$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/47/l2h/img17.png" title="$ z$" width="14" /></span> -transformation.</p>

<p>Hotelling was married in 1920 to Floy Tracy and they had two children. She died in 1932, and Hotelling later married Susanna Edmundson in 1934 and together they had five sons, and a daughter (who died in her infancy).</p>
<p>Hotelling was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1970 and received a number of other prestigious honors during his life. After a stroke the preceding year, Harold Hotelling died on December 26, 1973.<br />

<p><b>Oskar ANDERSON</b><br />
b. 2 August 1887 - d. 12 February 1960<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> A leading member of the Continental School of Statistics, Anderson contributed to a broad range of topics including correlation, time series analysis, nonparametric methods and sample surveys, as well as to econometrics and various other applications in the social sciences.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>1. Biography</b></p>
<p>Oskar Anderson's life and work were strongly influenced by the very turbulent period in Europe in the first half of the 20th century. At various times he lived in Russia, the Ukraine, Hungary, Bulgaria and Germany. Oskar Johann Viktor (or in the Russian way of noting first names: Oskar Nicolaevich) Anderson was born in Minsk, the son of Baltic-German parents, and he spent his first 30 years in Russia. His father, Nicolai Carl, was a professor of Finno-Ugric languages at the University of Kazan.</p>
<p>Anderson graduated from the grammar school in Kazan with a gold medal and studied mathematics and physics at the University of Kazan for a year. In 1907 he entered the Economics Faculty of the Polytechnical Institute in St. Petersburg to study mathematics, statistics and economics. He soon became the disciple and assistant of the well-known statistician Aleksandr A. Chuprov (q.v) who let him participate in the field work for the population census of 1910. At the end of 1912 he was awarded the degree of “candidate of economics" (corresponding to a doctor's degree at an international level) for a dissertation on the coefficient of correlation and its application to time series. Soon afterwards he obtained a law degree of the University of St. Petersburg and in addition to his activities as assistant he taught economics and law in a commercial secondary school. He was married in 1912 to Margarethe Natalie, née von Hindenburg-Hirtenberg.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1915, as Chuprov's collaborator, he participated in a governmental scientific expedition to Turkestan where he worked as a sampling expert for an agricultural census in the artificially irrigated regions along the Sir-Daria River. This was one of the first sample surveys in official statistics.</p>
<p>After the decline of the Tzar's empire in 1917 and the beginning of the Russian revolution, Anderson moved to Kiev where he worked in a big cooperative centre's department of economic research. In 1918 he qualified for lecturing on mathematical statistics at the Kiev School of Commerce. At the same time he became assistant to the director of the Demographic Institute of the Ukranian Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>In 1919/20, when the Soviets had conquered the whole country, Anderson decided to escape with his wife and children. During the flight, at Noworossijks on the north coast of the Black Sea, and under dramatic circumstances, the manuscript of his thesis and the first version of his work on the difference method, including all his calculations, had to be left behind on the pier with some other luggage.</p>
<p>Travelling via Constantinople, where the couple had to work with their hands to earn a living, they eventually arrived in Budapest in 1921 and there Anderson founded a secondary school for the children of Russian immigrants. Then, from 1923 Anderson and his family lived in Bulgaria, where he found a stable life as a scientist. First he was appointed a member of the Bulgarian Supreme Statistical Council. From 1924 to 1934 he taught statistics and economics at the High School of Commercial Sciences in Varna.</p>
<p>In 1935 Anderson became director of the Statistical Institute for Economic Research of the State University in Sofia, which was partly sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, and at the same time counsellor of the Bulgarian General Direction of Statistics. His activities, however, reached beyond Bulgaria. In 1930 he was invited to Cornell University in the USA. He was one of the charter members and fellows of the Econometric Society, founded in 1930 in the USA. At the end of 1935 he went to Germany and England on a Rockefeller stipend. In 1936 he lectured at the London School of Economics, from 1935 to 1939 he was a member of the International Association of Institutes for Economic Research, and from 1936 to 1939 he served as an associate member of the committee of statistical experts of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, Germany, appointed Anderson as Professor of Statistics in 1942. The appointment had a great influence on German university statistics and marked, after some stagnation, a revival of stochastic thinking. In addition to the professorship, Anderson was in charge of the Department of Eastern Studies at the Kiel Institute of World Economy. It is important to point out that Anderson never allowed politics to interfere with his scientific work. His moral integrity remained unquestioned.</p>
<p>In 1947 Anderson accepted appointment to the newly established Chair of Statistics at the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich where he continued his efforts to improve the academic teaching of statistics. He gathered a close group of disciples around him, particularly the future professors Eberhard Fels, Hans Kellerer and Heinrich Strecker. His son Oskar (Jr.) also became a statistician and was appointed professor at the Universities of Mannheim and Munich.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>2. Scientific Work</b></p>
<p><small class="SMALL"><b>Econometrics</b></small></p>
<p>Anderson was convinced that mathematical-statistical methods are indispensable tools for research in economics and social sciences. In his early research he developed the variate difference method for analyzing time series independently but contemporaneously with W.S. Gosset (“Student")(q.v.). With the basic idea that time series consist of a systematic component (trend, business cycle) and a superimposed independent random component, one tries to completely eliminate the systematic part of the series by taking finite differences. After taking sufficient differences the random component is left. This procedure assumes independence of the random components. These are, however, especially with economic time series, sometimes autocorrelated. Therefore this method was subject to lively debate for decades, with many distinguished scientists participating. Anderson's initiative and the discussions thereafter contributed considerably to the subject.</p>
<p>The same is true for Anderson's criticism of statistical methods used for the so-called Harvard Barometer of Business Conditions which resulted in the replacement of purely empirical methods by more efficient ones. In his papers, Anderson demonstrated the arbitrariness of the methods predominant at that time. He helped to overcome the mechanistic view of business cycles and to further the idea that the scientific exploration of reality is not feasible without theoretical hypotheses. As a consequence the modern theory of economic model building was founded. Anderson dealt with the problem of empirically formulating theoretical relationships in his paper “Ist die Quantitätstheorie des Geldes statisch nachweisbar?" (1931), one of the earliest pieces of econometric research.</p>
<p><small class="SMALL"><b>Statistics</b></small></p>
<p>There is hardly any field of statistical methodology of his time with which Anderson was not occupied. He brought with him to Bulgaria the experience gained in Russia, and with the sample survey in Turkestan. There he advocated the processing of data of the Census of Agriculture of 1926 by using random sampling techniques in addition to complete processing. The result of the comparison was amazingly good, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of sampling to all those statisticians who had not then accepted the method. The representative processing of the census was one of the first official surveys in the world applying random sampling - which establishes Anderson as a pioneer of the first order.</p>
<p>Anderson directed special attention to the often neglected fact that data are subject to errors which are propogated in further evaluation or combination of data. He always stressed the necessity to observe and, if need be, to take account of error propogation. His studies on index theory, above all the use and abuse of chain index numbers should be mentioned, as well as his contributions to the problem of “price scissors", i.e. the divergent movement of agricultural and industrial prices.</p>
<p>Another focus of Anderson's research lay in causal analysis which gained interest in his time. He concentrated on the case of data which were not obtained by experiment but by observing economic and population development. He considered regression and correlation methods as appropriate tools, particularly regression analysis, for the empirical assessment of causal relations.</p>
<p>In his last years, Anderson dealt with the development of non-parametric <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a>. Such distribution-free tests are important since the normal distribution is commonly the exception rather than the rule in in socio-economic sciences. Anderson developed non-parametric tests of the null hypothesis in the case of autocorrelation and correlation.</p>
<p>In his publications, especially his two textbooks, Anderson combined the tradition of the so-called Continental School of statistics with the concepts of the Anglo-Saxon School. In his <i>Einführung in die mathematische Statistik</i> (1935), Anderson included the results of his research to that time and thus he became one of the outstanding modern representatives of the Continental School. His second textbook, <i>Probleme der statistichen Methodenlehre in den Sozialwissenschaften</i> (1954) may be regarded as his crowning scientific endeavour. As in all of his previous publications, Anderson gives highest priority to defining basic concepts and the exact formulation of methods to be applied.</p>
<p>After World War II and the end of the isolation of German scientists Anderson provided recommendations for lecture courses for the German Statistical Society giving a guide by which teaching and research could be brought to an international level. This helped the discipline to regain its reputation after a long period of stagnation. This was also assisted by Anderson's establishment of the <i>Mitteilungsblatt für mathematische Statistik</i> in 1949 together with Hans Kellerer and Hans Münzner. This journal was combined in 1958 with the <i>Statistiche Vierteljahresscrift</i>, published in Vienna, and continued by Anderson and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=128" name="menu1">Wilhelm Winkler</a> under the heading <i>Metrika</i>.</p>
<p>Andersons scientific status was marked by many distinctions. He belonged amongst the scientists who paved the way for the application of quantitative methods in the socio-economic sciences and who developed tools in common use today. He was well aware of the difficulties in co-ordinating theory and practice. He warned of the danger that the best statistical technique could become useless if the model's assumptions are not met in reality or if they are applied to unreliable observations. His requirements remain true today.<br />

<p><b>John ARBUTHNOT</b><br />
b. 29 April 1667 - d. 27 February 1735<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> A physician and writer, the creator of John Bull, John Arbuthnot is known in statistics for his translation of Huygens' book on probability and for the first use of a <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">test</a> of significance.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>In assessing the eminent writers from the time of Queen Anne (1702 - 1714), James Boswell during the 1760's quoted the English lexicographer and writer Samuel Johnson as saying, “I think Dr.&nbsp;Arbuthnot the first man among them. He was the most universal genius, being an excellent physician, a man of deep learning, and a man of much humour.” (<em>Boswell's Life of Johnson</em>)</p>
<p>By profession, Arbuthnot was a physician, receiving the degree of Doctor of Medicine from St.&nbsp;Andrews in 1696. His medical practice included many leading figures of English society. By chance he provided medical services to Prince George, Queen Anne's consort. As a result he was appointed Physician Extraordinary to the Queen in 1705 and later Physician in Ordinary to the Queen in 1709. The range of his interests beyond his profession were great. Arbuthnot was an amateur musician with connections to the composer George Frederick Händel. He was active in the Royal Society serving on two committees in support of Sir Isaac Newton. He was a political satirist and an excellent conversationalist. Arbuthnot was also the author of eight scientific works which reflect a breadth of interest from mathematics to numismatics to dietetics. Today Arbuthnot is best known as a literary wit, the creator of the character John Bull, and as a close friend and collaborator of the leading writers of the day: Jonathan Swift, John Gay and Alexander Pope.</p>
<p>Arbuthnot's contributions to the development of probability were minor yet indicative of the status of probability as a subject of inquiry in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Following the publication of Huygens's (q.v.) <em>De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae</em> in 1657, very little was published in probability, either in volume or in substance, until Montmort's (q.v.) <em>Essai d'Analyse sur les Jeux de Hazards</em> in 1708. Stephen Stigler refers to this time period as the dark ages of the theory of probability.</p>
<p>In 1692 Arbuthnot published <em>Of the Laws of Chance</em>, a translation of <em>De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae</em> with some additions containing probability calculations on various dice and card games. <em>Of the Laws of Chance</em> was a popular book. It went through four editions, the last published three years after Arbuthnot's death. Each edition was printed by Benjamin Motte, a Tory in politics as was Arbuthnot. The 1692 edition appears to have been one of the first books off Motte's press. Later Motte published the first edition of Swift's <em>Gulliver's Travels</em>. <em>Of the Laws of Chance</em> was written anonymously as were all of Arbuthnot's writings. Some of Arbuthnot's serious works appear under his own name.</p>
<p>The preface to <em>Of the Laws of Chance</em> shows that the book was intended as a gambling manual which perhaps explains its popularity. Arbuthnot probably wrote the book as a means to make money. The first edition was written during a time of personal upheaval for Arbuthnot. His father, an Episcopalian-Jacobite clergyman, had been deposed after the Glorious Revolution (1688) and died three years later. Arbuthnot, who probably intended to follow his father into the Church, left Scotland in 1691 for London where initially he established himself as a gentlemen's tutor in mathematics. The initial 1692 publication on probability falls naturally into a time period when Arbuthnot was apparently viewing mathematics as leading to a possible profession. <em>Of the Laws of Chance</em> appeared in a second edition in 1714 and a fourth edition posthumously in 1738.</p>
<p>In 1694 Arbuthnot entered University College, Oxford, as a fellow-commoner where he met David Gregory, Savilian Professor of Astronomy. Both were alumni of the University of Aberdeen. Probably at this time Gregory obtained a manuscript on chance written by Arbuthnot and dated 1694 by Gregory. Arbuthnot may have used the manuscript as his own personal introduction to Gregory. The manuscript contains some generalisations of the work appearing in <em>Of the Laws of Chance</em> and an anticipation, including the first use of significance tests, of Arbuthnot's later work on the sex ratio published in 1710 in <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</em>. The 1710 paper is an attempt using statistics on the relative number births of males and females to demonstrate one aspect of the providence of God.</p>
<p>Arbuthnot's mathematical career ended and his medical career began after he received his medical degree in 1696. There are some possible probabilistic twists to the beginning of this career. Archibald Pitcaime, a Scottish physician, was closely involved in helping Arbuthnot take his doctoral examination. Between 1693 and 1695 Pitcaime tried to apply Huygens's work in probability to medicine, in particular to the secretion of blood and to the cure of fevers. It is likely that Pitcaime's introduction to the work of Huygens was through Arbuthnot.</p>
<p>In philosophy Arbuthnot was a Newtonian, defined by the <em>Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy</em> as one who has a “view of nature as a universal system of mathematical reason and order divinely created and administered”. This is readily apparent in Arbuthnot's preface to <em>Of the Laws of Chance</em>. For example at one point in the preface there is a short discussion of providence as it relates to chance or casual events. Later in the preface Arbuthnot states, “all the Politicks in the World are nothing else but a kind of Analysis of the Quantity of Probability in casual Events, and a good Politician signifies no more, but one who is dexterous at such Calculations”.</p>
<p>Arbuthnot had a continuing interest in mathematics in general and probability in particular. His library was sold in 1779 and contained at the time of sale the 1718 edition of DeMoivre's <em>Doctrine of Chances</em>, DeMoivre's <em>Miscellanea Analytica</em> published 1730 and other mathematical books.</p>
<p>Biographical material on Arbuthnot may be found in [1, 7] and his known publications with probability content are listed in [2, 3, 4, 5]. Discussion of his work in probability may be found in [6, 8, 10, 12, 15]. Other references of interest are [9, 11, 13, 14].<br />

<p><b>Louis BACHELIER</b><br />
b. 11 March 1870 - d. 28 April 1946<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Bachelier constructed the first mathematical theory of Brownian motion, and obtained numerous results which are both remarkable and unacknowledged, on the trajectories of stochastic processes.</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p>For a contemporary mathematician, Bachelier's story is strikingly 1different. He was initially overlooked and obtained his first permanent university position at the age of 57, achieving fame only 20 years after his death. Bachelier was born in Le Havre, France, into a family immersed in banking and business. His father, from the Bordeaux region, was a wine merchant and acted as Vice-Consul for Venezuela. His maternal grandfather J.B. Fort-Meu, founded a banking company serving the district of Le Havre. Bachelier matriculated at Caen in 1888, but his father's death forced him to interrupt his studies. He took them up again at the age of 22, and was successful in obtaining an undistinguished Bachelor's degree in Paris in October 1895. He then defended his doctoral thesis, entitled “Théorie de la spéculation" and written under the supervision of Henri Poincaré, on 29 March 1900; this was classified as “honorable". The aim of the thesis was “the application of the calculus of probabilities to stockmarket operations", and was followed by several further notes, papers and original contributions on probabilities until 1914. Bachelier was then mobilised, first as a simple private and later as an officer, until the end of the World War 1.</p>
<p>Bachelier was unable to obtain a university post after he was awarded his doctorate, and had to find non-academic work. Nevertheless, he gave some unpaid lectures at the Sorbonne on the calculus of probabilities from 1910 to 1914. After returning from the war, he first completed an assignment for the Ministry of Labour in Alsace-Lorraine, after which he occupied various precarious positions in the universities of Besançon, Dijon and Rennes. He was finally tenured at Besançon in 1927, where his teaching was well appreciated by his students. He retired in 1937 and until his death lived at St. Malo.</p>
<p>Bachelier's thesis contains three different versions of the first mathematical theory of Brownian motion (five years before Einstein). In modern terminology, Brownian motion was characterized as:</p>
<p>a) a process with independent homogeneous increments whose paths are continuous,<br />
b) the continuous time process which is the limit of symmetric random walks, and<br />
c) the Markov process whose forward Kolmogorov equation is the heat equation.</p>
<p>Bachelier made a detailed study of the sample paths of Brownian motion thirty years before Paul Lévy, using the reflection principle and the strong Markov property. One may interpret this thesis as the fusion of two seemingly very disparate traditions.</p>
<p>The first, which acted as a guideline for Bachelier, was that of French mathematical physics in the tradition of J. Fourier, G. Lamé and obviously Poincaré. Bachelier drew his analogies, such as the evolution of probabilities, from their ideas. The second was the tacit rational models of stockmarket speculators which were used in a less formalised fashion during the second half of the 19th century. It is possible that a work of Jules Regnault in 1863 already contained, in a more literary form, the conceptual setting for the application of probability to stockmarket operations. In particular, this stated that “the standard deviation of a large number of operations, is in direct proportion to the square root of time". From the mathematical viewpoint, Bachelier's entire thesis is essentially correct; however, as the hypotheses were not always precisely stated, several mathematicians starting with Gevrey and Paul Lévy thought it was gravely in error. The newness of the subject at the beginning of the century, and these negative evaluations resulted in Bachelier's work being overlooked, and when read, not understood.</p>
<p>However, not only was his thesis remarkable, but his later researches were even more so, though they were largely ignored despite a certain measure of support from Poincaré. For example, Bachelier's paper of 1906 provides definitions of the classes of stochastic processes which appeared later: processes with independent increments, Markov processes, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. These definitions appear as consequences of a more general theory: that of stochastic differential equations, which Bachelier developed, without all the rigour to which we are now accustomed, using a vocabulary gleaned from games of chance.</p>
<p>Two functions play a key role in his paper: the first, called “espérance relative à une partie" is what we now call the “drift" of the stochastic differential equation, while the second called “fonction d'instabilité relative à une partie" is the coefficient of diffusion of this equation. Bachelier's arguments concentrate on paths: his equations define a motion, and call to mind Langevin (1908) and, later, work of Ito and Lévy.</p>
<p>In addition, Bachelier introduced an interesting theory of “inverse probability" and of “probability of causes", that is of statistical estimation, which he pursued in a treatise on the calculus of probabilities published in 1912, which is as clear as it is remarquable. Bachelier was subjected to much derision. In a confidential note to the Rector at Besançon dated 26 May 1921, the Director of Higher Education, providing a confidential evaluation, wrote “His situation is certainly precarious. But he owes it to me, despite the contrary advice of most of the mathematicians. He is not a high flier, and his work is rather peculiar. But he has served well during the war, and we had not been sufficiently fair to him. In effect, he has been placed on trial in your Faculty".</p>
<p>The only scholar who truly recognized the depth of Bachelier's work was Kolmogorov, in his great paper which is at the basis of modern stochastic processes theory “Uber die analytischen Methoden in der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung" of 1931. But after 1930, only Kolmogorov was read, and only those parts of Bachelier's work reproduced in the Soviet author's treatises became known. As for the stock market speculators, they did not need Bachelier's results, which were considered too theoretical to be operationally useful. It was only in the years 1960-1970 that the merit of this French mathematician was recognized by probabilists, and later by financiers, as the new rules for trading options became current. In the 1990's Bachelier Seminars have been created, as has also an international Bachelier Society focussed on the mathematics of finance.<br />

<p><b>Thomas BAYES</b><br />
b.c. 1701 - d. 7 April 1761<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> The problem of passing from a population to the properties of a sample was one of the first studied in probability. Thomas Bayes, a nonconformist minister, was the first to solve the inverse problem of passage from sample to population, using ideas that are widely used today.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Thomas Bayes, born in London, the son of a nonconformist minister, spent most of his adult life in a similar position in Tunbridge Wells, England. He was educated at Edinburgh University and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1742. During his lifetime he published a few mathematical papers, of which the best-known is a 1736 defence of Newton's ideas against an attack by Bishop Berkeley. He is today remembered for a paper that his friend Richard Price claimed to have found amongst his possessions after death. It appeared in the Society's Transactions in 1763 and has often been republished. Apart from these bare facts, surprisingly little is known of Bayes' life.</p>
<p>By the middle of the 18th century it was well-understood that if, to use modern terminology, in each of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img1.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> independent trials, the chance of success had the same value, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img2.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> say; then the probability of exactly <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img3.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> successes was given by the binomial distribution</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle P(r\vert\theta,n) = {n \choose r}\theta^r(1-\theta)^{n-r}.$" border="0" height="63" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img4.png" title="$\displaystyle P(r\vert\theta,n) = {n \choose r}\theta^r(1-\theta)^{n-r}.$" width="246" /></div>
<p>Jacob Bernoulli (q.v.) had established the weak law of large numbers and de Moivre (q.v.) had found the normal approximation to the binomial. The passage from a known value of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img5.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> to the empirical observation of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img6.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> was therefore extensively appreciated. Bayes studied the inverse problem; what did the data <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (r,n)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img7.png" title="$ (r,n)$" width="47" /></span> say about the chance <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img8.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> ? There already existed partial answers. For example, Arbuthnot had observed <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img9.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> male, and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ n-r$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img10.png" title="$ n-r$" width="48" /></span> female, births with <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img11.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> considerably in excess of <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 1/2n$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img12.png" title="$ 1/2n$" width="44" /></span> . He argued that, on the basis of the binomial with <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \theta = 1/2$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img13.png" title="$ \theta = 1/2$" width="67" /></span> , a value of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img14.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> as high as this was so improbable that <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img15.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> could not be <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 1/2$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img16.png" title="$ 1/2$" width="33" /></span> . That idea has been much extended into the modern form of a significance <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">test</a> and its associated <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ P$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img17.png" title="$ P$" width="19" /></span> -value or significance level.</p>
<p>Bayes proceeded differently using the theorem that nowadays always bears his name, though it does not appear explicitly in the 1763 paper,</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle P(A\vert B) = P(B\vert A)P(A)/P(B)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img18.png" title="$\displaystyle P(A\vert B) = P(B\vert A)P(A)/P(B)$" width="254" /></div>
<p>for events <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ A, B$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img19.png" title="$ A, B$" width="42" /></span> with <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(B)\neq 0$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img20.png" title="$ P(B)\neq 0$" width="84" /></span> . The theorem permits the inversion of the events in <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(B\vert A)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img21.png" title="$ P(B\vert A)$" width="68" /></span> into <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(A\vert B)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img22.png" title="$ P(A\vert B)$" width="68" /></span> . Applied when <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ A$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img23.png" title="$ A$" width="19" /></span> refers to <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img24.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ B$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img25.png" title="$ B$" width="20" /></span> to the empirical <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img26.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> , we have</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle P(\theta\vert r,n) \propto P(r\vert\theta,n)P(\theta\vert n).$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img27.png" title="$\displaystyle P(\theta\vert r,n) \propto P(r\vert\theta,n)P(\theta\vert n).$" width="234" /></div>
<p>(The missing constant of proportionality does not depend on <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img28.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> . It is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(r\vert n)^{-1}$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img29.png" title="$ P(r\vert n)^{-1}$" width="77" /></span> but is most easily found by making the product integrate to one by multiplying by the constant). The result effects the passage from the binomial, on the right, to a probability statement about the change, on the left. It therefore becomes possible to pass from the data to a statement about what are probable, and what are improbable, values of the chance.</p>
<p>This elegantly and simply solves the problem, except for one difficulty. It requires a value for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(\theta\vert n)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img30.png" title="$ P(\theta\vert n)$" width="60" /></span> , a probability distribution for the chance before the result of the trials has been observed. It is usual to describe this as the prior distribution (prior, that is, to <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img31.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> ) and the final result as the posterior distribution. Thus the theorem describes how your views of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img32.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> change, from prior to posterior, as a result of data <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img33.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> . Bayes discussed the choice of prior but his approach is ambiguous. He is usually supposed to have taken <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(\theta\vert n)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img34.png" title="$ P(\theta\vert n)$" width="60" /></span> uniform in (0,1) - the so-called Bayes's postulate - but an alternative reading suggests he took <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(r\vert n)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img35.png" title="$ P(r\vert n)$" width="59" /></span> to be uniform. Mathematically these lead to the same result.</p>
<p>Little notice was taken of the 1763 paper at the time. It was first appreciated by Laplace (q.v.), in the early years of the next century, who used the ideas in his eclectic approach to probability. The theorem is of basic importance because it provides a solution to the general problem of inference or induction. Let <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img36.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> be a universal hypothesis and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ E$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img37.png" title="$ E$" width="20" /></span> empirical evidence bearing on <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img38.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> . A simple example might be <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img39.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> , all swans are white, and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ E$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img40.png" title="$ E$" width="20" /></span> the observation of the colour of a swan. A more sophisticated one would have <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img41.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> as Newton's laws and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ E$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img42.png" title="$ E$" width="20" /></span> observation of the motions of the planets. In either case, <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(E\vert H)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img43.png" title="$ P(E\vert H)$" width="71" /></span> can be calculated. Bayes's theorem says</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle P(H\vert E) \propto P(E\vert H)P(H),$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img44.png" title="$\displaystyle P(H\vert E) \propto P(E\vert H)P(H),$" width="214" /></div>
<p>expressing a view about the hypothesis, given the evidence, in terms of the known probability of the evidence, given the hypothesis, and the prior view about <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img45.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> . As more evidence supporting <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img46.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> accrues, having large probability on <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img47.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> , so even the sceptic, with low <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(H)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img48.png" title="$ P(H)$" width="51" /></span> , will become convinced, <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(H\vert E)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img49.png" title="$ P(H\vert E)$" width="71" /></span> will approach one and the hypothesis accepted. Many people, following Jeffreys (q.v.), who extensively developed these ideas into a practicable scientific tool, hold that this provides a description of the scientific method. This view differs from that of Popper, who only admits refutation of a hypothesis and whose attitude to probability is regarded as unsound by supporters of Jeffrey's ideas.</p>
<p>Recently Bayes's theorem has been used as a means of processing evidence in a court of law. Let <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ G$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img50.png" title="$ G$" width="20" /></span> be the hypothesis that the defendant is truly guilty of the offence with which he or she has been charged and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ E$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img51.png" title="$ E$" width="20" /></span> a new piece of evidence. Then applying the theorem both to <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ G$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img52.png" title="$ G$" width="20" /></span> and to <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \bar G$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img53.png" title="$ \bar G$" width="20" /></span> , denoting innocence,</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle \frac{P(G\vert E)}{P(\bar G\vert E)} = \frac{P(E\vert G)}{P(E\vert\bar G)}\;\frac{P(G)}{P(\bar G)}.$" border="0" height="62" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img54.png" title="$\displaystyle \frac{P(G\vert E)}{P(\bar G\vert E)} = \frac{P(E\vert G)}{P(E\vert\bar G)}\;\frac{P(G)}{P(\bar G)}.$" width="224" /></div>
<p>The expression on the left is the odds on guilt, given <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ E$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img55.png" title="$ E$" width="20" /></span> ; that on the right is the same odds without <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ E$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img56.png" title="$ E$" width="20" /></span> . The remaining term is the likelihood ratio, being a comparison of the probability of the evidence, supposing guilt, to the same probability supposing innocence. Forensic scientists present evidence to the court in the form of a likelihood ratio. The court can then multiply their former (prior) odds by the likelihood ratio to obtain new (posterior) odds as a result of hearing the evidence.</p>
<p>Bayes's result has attained increased importance following work by Ramsey, de Finetti and Savage between 1925 and 1955, which demonstrated that our knowledge had to be based on probability and that our beliefs must obey the rules of the probability calculus, of which Bayes's is essentially the multiplication rule. In this view, the significance levels of the classical school are unsound because they do not express opinions about hypotheses like <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img57.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> , or parameters like <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img58.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> , in terms of direct probabilities of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ H$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img59.png" title="$ H$" width="22" /></span> or <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img60.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> . The resulting methodology is called Bayesian statistics and has rather different procedures and results from those of the classical school. Bayesians regard probability as a measure of a person's belief, whereas the classical school only admits probability as a frequency concept.</p>
<p>Bayes's result is also central to modern ideas on decision-making under uncertainty. Suppose there is a choice to be made amongst a set <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ {d}$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img61.png" title="$ {d}$" width="14" /></span> of decisions in the presence of uncertainty about a parameter <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img62.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> . The work of Ramsey and others leads to the introduction of a utility function <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ u(d, \theta)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img63.png" title="$ u(d, \theta)$" width="57" /></span> ; describing the worth of decision <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ d$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img64.png" title="$ d$" width="14" /></span> when the parameter has the value <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img65.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> , and the choice of that <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ d$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img66.png" title="$ d$" width="14" /></span> which maximizes the expected utility <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \sigma_{\theta}u(d,\theta)P(\theta)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img67.png" title="$ \sigma_{\theta}u(d,\theta)P(\theta)$" width="114" /></span> . Additional evidence <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ E$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img68.png" title="$ E$" width="20" /></span> updates <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(\theta)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img69.png" title="$ P(\theta)$" width="43" /></span> to <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(\theta\vert E)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/4/l2h/img70.png" title="$ P(\theta\vert E)$" width="63" /></span> , by the theorem, and improves the decision-making. All this is a long way from Bayes's original problem and its resolution. He would doubtless be astonished were he to realize how his wonderful idea has been extended and his name used.<br />

<p><b>Sergei Natanovich BERNSTEIN</b><br />
b. 22 February 1880 (o.s.) - d. 26 October 1968<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b> Bernstein's training in and continuing contacts with Paris led him to combine analytical writing with the traditions of the St.Petersburg School in probability. Martingale differences appear in his work, and best known are his extensions of the Central Limit Theorem to weakly dependent random variables.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Bernstein was born in Odessa in the then Russian Empire. His father was a doctor and university lecturer, and the family was Jewish, with the attendant difficulties. On completing high school Bernstein went to Paris for his mathematical education, and defended a doctoral dissertation in pure mathematics in 1904 at the Sorbonne. He returned in 1905 and taught at Kharkov University from 1908 to 1933; the system of czarist universities, and possibly his Jewishness, made it necessary to defend another doctoral dissertation in pure mathematics in 1913. <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=77" name="menu1">Jerzy Neyman</a> (q.v.) recollects lectures at Kharkov University in 1915 or 1916 by Bernstein on probability, and that it was Bernstein who suggested to him that he read <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a>'s <i>Grammar of Science</i>. Clearly, given Neyman's influence on the direction of mathematical statistics subsequently, Bernstein was influential in this sense also, quite apart from his many and striking contributions to probability theory.</p>
<p>After the revolution Bernstein became professor at Kharkov University, and became active in the Soviet reorganization of tertiary institutions, as a national commissar for education, for example in the establishment in Kharkov of the All-Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1928. During the quickly-suppressed period of Ukrainianization within the time when Kharkov (Kharkiv in Ukrainian) was capital (1919-1934) of the Ukrainian SRS, he refused to use the Ukrainian language, although there is a publication of his in 1928 (on the concept of correlation between statistical variables) written in this language. This would have put him at variance with the chairman (1927-1933) of national commissars for education of Ukraine, M.V. Skrypnyk (1872-1933, who under Stalinist pressure committed suicide), and mathematicians such as M.P. Kravchuk (q.v.).</p>
<p>Possibly finding Markov's (q.v.) <i>Ischislenie Veroiatnostei</i> dated as a didactic aid, Bernstein produced an elegant textbook <i>Teoriia Veroiatnostei</i> which first appeared in 1927, went to 2nd and 3rd editions in 1934, with a final 4th edition in 1946. There were substantial changes in the successive editions, and the 4th edition contains a significant amount of new research material, especially on his own incomplete axiomatization of probability, and on inhomogeneous Markov chains. He was very familiar with the probabilistic work of the Petersburg School and wrote a splendid commentary on Chebyshev's (q.v.) probabilistic work in 1945 and can well be thought of as succeeding Liapunov (who left it in 1902) at Kharkov University. Even though the origins of the Petersburg direction themselves were largely under French influence due to Buniakovsky and Chebyshev, Bernstein's own training in and contact with Paris, shown in his heavily analytical writing, helped him combine its manifestation with then-current European thinking. The scope of his probabilistic work in general was ahead of its time, and his writings, including his book, helped significantly to shape the development of probability, and not only in the USSR.</p>
<p>Berstein took a keen interest in the methodology of teaching mathematics at secondary and tertiary levels, and popularizing its use. His official bibliography of about 265 items contains numerous book reviews and articles in <i>Pedagogicheskii Sbornik</i> in prerevolutionary years, and after in journals such as <i>Nauka na Ukraine</i>, for example an article in 1922 entitled “On the application of mathematics to biology". These activities doubtless contributed to his appointment as a national commissar for education, and, at least in the years prior to 1933, helped to further the standing of mathematics.</p>
<p>From 1933 Bernstein worked at the Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Leningrad (now again called St. Petersburg), and also taught at the University and Polytechnic Institute. From January, 1939, Bernstein worked also at Moscow University. He and his wife were evacuated to Kazakhstan before Leningrad was blockaded by German Armies from September 8, 1941 to January, 1943 . From 1943 he worked at the Mathematical Institute in Moscow.</p>
<p>In the years 1952-1964 he spent much time in the editing and publication of the four-volume collection of his mathematical works, which contains commentaries by his students and experts in various fields. The first 3 volumes deal with essentially non-probabilistic themes. The 4th volume is entitled <i>Theory of Probability and Mathematical Statistics [1911-1946]</i>. One problem to which he kept returning was the accuracy of the normal approximation to the normal distribution. In fact a theme of his work was reexamination in a new light of the main existing theorems of probability theory, such as extension to dependent random variables of the Weak Law of Large Numbers. (This law deals with conditions under which the sample means <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {\bar X}_n = (X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_{n})/n$" border="0" height="39" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img1.png" title="$ {\bar X}_n = (X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_{n})/n$" width="251" /></span> formed from a sequence <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \{X_{n}\}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img2.png" title="$ \{X_{n}\}$" width="48" /></span> of random variables converge in probability to a constant, as <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img3.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> increases.) The characterization of the normal distribution through independence of linear forms in two random variables is usually referred to as Bernstein's Theorem. The name Bernstein's Inequality has its origin in a paper of 1924 and is applied to a number of inequalities, the most common of which is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P(X \geq a) \leq e^{-at} M(t)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img4.png" title="$ P(X \geq a) \leq e^{-at} M(t)$" width="185" /></span> , for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ t &gt; 0$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img5.png" title="$ t &gt; 0$" width="46" /></span> , where <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ M(t)=E(e^{Xt}) $" border="0" height="39" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img6.png" title="$ M(t)=E(e^{Xt}) $" width="127" /></span> . (This follows immediately from Markov's Inequality.)</p>
<p>Little known (although partly translated into English) is a surprisingly advanced (for its time, 1924) mathematical investigation in population genetics, involving a synthesis of Mendelian inheritance and Galtonian “laws" of inheritance.</p>
<p>The idea of martingale differences appears in his work; and probably best-known are his extensions of the Central Limit Theorem to “weakly dependent random variables". The classical limit theorems (the Weak Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem) are concerned with the probabilistic behaviour as <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n \rightarrow \infty$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img7.png" title="$ n \rightarrow \infty$" width="65" /></span> of the partial sums <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \{S_{n}\}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img8.png" title="$ \{S_{n}\}$" width="44" /></span> where <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ S_n=X_1+X_2+...+X_n $" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img9.png" title="$ S_n=X_1+X_2+...+X_n $" width="206" /></span> of a sequence of <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \{X_{n}\}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img10.png" title="$ \{X_{n}\}$" width="48" /></span> of <i>independent</i> random variables with zero mean <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (E X_n = 0)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img11.png" title="$ (E X_n = 0)$" width="93" /></span> . For the more general concept of a <i>martingale difference</i> sequence of random variables <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \{X_{n}\}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img12.png" title="$ \{X_{n}\}$" width="48" /></span> , the property <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ E(X_n \vert X_{n-1} , X_{n-2} , \cdots, X_1) = 0$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img13.png" title="$ E(X_n \vert X_{n-1} , X_{n-2} , \cdots, X_1) = 0$" width="259" /></span> is retained. These are Bernstein's “first order dependent random variables". Since <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ X_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img14.png" title="$ X_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$" width="136" /></span> , this defining property can be formulated as <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ E(S_n - S_{n-1} \vert S_{n-1} , S_{n-2}, \cdots, S_1) = 0$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img15.png" title="$ E(S_n - S_{n-1} \vert S_{n-1} , S_{n-2}, \cdots, S_1) = 0$" width="304" /></span> . The sequence <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \{S_{n}\}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img16.png" title="$ \{S_{n}\}$" width="44" /></span> of partial sums is now called a <i>martingale</i>. It has the property <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ E(S_n \vert S_{n-1} , \cdots, S_1) = S_{n-1}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img17.png" title="$ E(S_n \vert S_{n-1} , \cdots, S_1) = S_{n-1}$" width="225" /></span> and the sequence <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \{X_{n}\}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/5/l2h/img18.png" title="$ \{X_{n}\}$" width="48" /></span> is thus one of “martingale differences".</p>
<p>For the statistician especially, of interest is a paper of 1941 entitled <i>On the “fiducial" probabilities of Fisher.</i></p>
<p>The Bernstein polynomials have a number of uses in probabilistic contexts.</p>
<p>Bernstein's students included G.A. Ambartsumian, V.P. Savkevich, O.V. Sarmanov, H.A. Sapogov. An epitaph which he might have chosen for himself preceded a prize-winning work of his (1911):</p>
<blockquote>La vie est brève<br />
Un peu de rêve<br />
Un peu d'espoir<br />
Et puis bonsoir.</blockquote>

<p><b>Joseph BERTRAND</b><br />
b. 11 March 1822 - d. 3 April 1900<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Bertrand brought several interesting innovations into the probability calculus, but it is above all for his role as teacher, as publicist, and as critic (indeed as polemicist) that he is known to history.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Joseph Bertrand, who was born and died in Paris, was a prodigy who fulfilled his childhood promise. He was the son of Alexandre Bertrand, a graduate of the Ecole Polytechnique who was an expert on sleepwalking, ecstasy and other extraordinary states of consciousness. Joseph, orphaned at the age of nine, was raised by his uncle, the mathematician J.M.C. Duhamel (1797-1872), who left him free to study as he pleased. Joseph Bertrand held all the French records for precocity at the university; he was allowed to follow lectures at the Ecole Polytechnique at the age of 11, and was awarded his doctorate in the mathematical sciences at sixteen. He was then admitted as the top candidate at the Ecole Polytechnique, having at last reached the age required to compete officially in the entrance examinations. This was a unique case, where a pupil had already won his doctorate and was more qualified and knowledgeable than his teachers. At the age of 25, he was appointed as an interim professor of mathematical physics at the Collège de France, the most prestigious French institution of scholarship, to replace J.B. Biot (1771-1862), the last representative of Laplacian science and of the Société d'Arcueil. After Biot's death in 1862, Bertrand was appointed to the Chair.</p>
<p>Joseph Bertrand became a tutor <i>répetiteur</i> in analysis at the Ecole Polytechnique in 1844 (until 1856) and Chair professor in the subject from 1856 to 1895. He thus taught 50 intakes of Polytechnique students, among them some of the most renowned French scientists of the second half of the 19th century, as well as eventually famous representatives of industry, senior administration and the army. Bertrand was an exceptional teacher, brilliant, witty, always clear and precise, avoiding obscurities and limiting his lectures to what he himself could understand perfectly, or at least give the impression of understanding perfectly.</p>
<p>On Sturm's death in 1856, he was elected to membership of the Academy of Sciences. He became its permanent secretary for the mathematical sciences from 1874 until his death. In this capacity, he produced two volumes of academic eulogies, elegant and witty in the style of the period, which secured his election in 1884 to the Académie Française.</p>
<p>Bertrand's mathematical work was important and occasionally brilliant, but perhaps not profound. It was concerned with branches of mathematics in vogue in the second half of the 19th century, analysis and geometry of course, but also arithmetic and algebra for which he had a strong flair (Bertrand's curves, Bertrand series, Bertrand's postulate). His acknowledged master in all things was Gauss (q.v.), and his models Abel and Jacobi.</p>
<p>From an early age, Bertrand revealed his notable gift as a polemicist. His ferocious and deadly irony rapidly assured him of leadership in the numerous institutions of which he was a member. His natural authority, and an understanding of the subtleties of arbitration, assisted by carefully selected and maintained family alliances assured him of automatic majorities at the Sorbonne, the Academy of Sciences, the Ecole Polytechnique and the Collège de France. Bertrand was the brother in law of the benevolent Charles Hermite (1822-1920), who described him as “ill-disposed and ill-natured; with him one could not be totally sure of anything". Bertrand was also an uncle by marriage of Paul Appell (1855-1930)- who was himself the father in law of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=10" name="menu0">Emile Borel</a> (q.v)- as well as of Emile Picard (1856-1941). For the best part of half a century, Bertrand almost singly acted as caretaker of the French mathematical sciences; there is no other example of such power, except for that, even greater from all points of view, of the earlier Siméon-Denis Poisson (q.v.).</p>
<p>Bertrand early became interested in the calculus of probabilities, which he taught for 40 years at the Ecole Polytechnique and for several years at the Collège de France. It was he who translated Gauss' papers on the Method of Least Squares into French; he loved Gauss' algebraic clarity, in contrast to Laplace's (q.v.) analytic obscurities. He was interested in combinatorial analysis, whose profound aesthetics he was one of the first to appreciate in France: his students Emile Barbier and Désiré André later contributed to its development. It was without any doubt Bertrand who popularized the Method of Expectations in which the expectation of the indicator function of an event, rather than its probability, is calculated. His large treatise <i>Calcul des probabilités</i>, the conclusion of 40 years of carefully revised teaching, went through two editions (1888 and 1907). Its success is largely due to the enormous gap in France between the probability books of Poisson of 1837 and of Cournot(q.v) of 1843, and his own, filled in part only by the book of H. Laurent in 1873. Bertrand's book is of great interest on more than one count, and not only because it served as a reference text for all mathematicians interested in the theory of probability at the beginning of the 20th century. Apart from some regrettably narrow-minded views, as for example on Condorcet (q.v.), Canard and Cournot, that is: against the use of mathematics in economics and the human sciences, this book is remarkably well written, and could well serve to exemplify a certain type of French intellect at the end of the last century. In it, one can certainly find the famous Bertrand paradox on the different ways of drawing a chord at random in a circle; this is a paradox which Bertrand in his handwritten lecture notes for the Ecole Polytechnique constructed in stages as a transformation of the famous Buffon needle problem. More importantly, his Chapter VI on the gamblers' ruin is at the very foundation of modern research on the theory of Brownian motion and the sums of independent random variables. Bachelier (q.v.) found much inspiration in it, and through him modern probabilists. Poincaré, Hadamard, Borel and Paul Lévy studied Bertrand's treatise, for which they always showed the greatest respect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bertrand remained resolutely hostile to Laplacian or Bayesian statistical theory: the chapters on these topics in his book are totally sceptical. The “probability of causes" was, to his mind, too arbitrarily tied to the prior distribution to be useable in practice under any circumstances. However, his comments are often acute and lucid. Bertrand's hostility to Laplace extended to Bienaymé (q.v.), who near the end of his life expressed small regard for some of Bertrand's contributions. Bertrand's book helped bury the memory of Bienaymé's contributions by an inadequate and negative treatment. Bienaymé's probabilistic alter-ego, Chebyshev (q.v.) is not mentioned once. In a letter to Chebyshev, Catalan writes with uncharacteristic mildness: “Quel drôle de livre! [What a funny book!]". There were several clashes between Catalan and Bertrand, but few were prepared to take Bertrand on. However, Bertrand did not always emerge unscathed; the best known instance is “L'Affaire Carton" of 1869 when he presented for publication in the <i>Comptes Rendus</i> of the Academy a paper by one Jules Carton which purported to give a proof of Euclid's parallels postulate. Liouville and Bienaymé, and then Darboux, Beltrami and Hoűel, opposed publication for obvious reasons. Darboux, a former pupil of Bertrand, finally succeeded in persuading him his position was wrong.</p>
<p>The only areas of application of the calculus of probabilities in which Bertrand was apparently interested were artillery accuracy (in which he was the forerunner of Gaussian statistics, correlation, axes of inertia), topics in geodesy (although his chapters on the Method of Least Squares were not totally convincing), and particularly problems of insurance, certain aspects of which he attempted to clarify. In this respect, Bertrand is very representative of his period and his “School". In fact, during the second half of the 19th century after a period of decline in mid-century, graduates from the Ecole Polytechnique excelled, in the tradition of Poisson, in the probabilistic study of the dispersion of different artillery firings, as can be seen from the lectures of Henry (1894). This even became a specialty of the applied military schools (Metz and later Fontainebleau), with artillery men creating, within the milieu of the military, several modern statistical tools such as chi-square. It was graduates of the Ecole Polytechnique who also transformed actuarial methods. Among them were H. Laurent, and E. Dormoy who developed a coefficient for the study of stability and non-normality in statistical series at the same time as Lexis(q.v.) in Germany. Most of these mathematicians had followed the lectures of Bertrand, who had incorporated the advances of his students into both his teaching and his treatise.</p>
<p>At a time when French science was no longer central in the world, Joseph Bertrand played an arguably indispensable (if somewhat questionable) role, particularly in the renaissance at the beginning of the 20th century of the French school of probability. Fortune,too, played no little part in his ascendancy. According to the concluding lines of Zerner(1991), a concurrence of circumstances ensured that an oligarch became de facto a monarch, even though posterity retains almost nothing of his mathematical work. One of these was that Bertrand arrived at adulthood in a period poor in first rate mathematicians.<br />

<p><b>Carlo Emilio BONFERRONI</b><br />
b. 28 January 1892 - d. 18 August 1960<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> His name is attached to the Bonferroni Inequalities which facilitate the treatment of statistical dependence. Improvements to the inequalities have generated a large literature.</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Carlo Emilio Bonferroni was born in 1892 at Bergamo, a university town in northern Italy. He studied conducting and piano at the conservatory in Torino (Turin), and then studied for the degree of <i>laurea</i> in mathematics in Torino under Peano and Segre. He spent a year broadening his education in Wien (Vienna) at the University, and in Zürich at the Eidgenössicher Technischen Hochschule. During the 1914-1918 war he served as an officer in the engineers. He became <i>incaricato</i> (assistant professor) at the Turin Polytechnic, and then in 1923 took up the chair of financial mathematics at the Economics Institute in Bari where he was also Rector for 7 years. In 1933 he transferred to Firenze (Florence) where he held his chair until his death in 1960. He was Dean of his Faculty for five years. He received honours from within his own country, but the only one from outside was from the Hungarian Statistical Society.</p>
<p>The obituary of him by Pagni lists his works under three main headings: actuarial mathematics (16 articles, 1 book); probability and statistical mathematics (30, 1); analysis, geometry and rational mechanics (13, 0). His name is familiar in the statistical world through his 1936 paper in which the Bonferroni Inequalities first appear. If <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p_i$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img1.png" title="$ p_i$" width="20" /></span> is the probability of having characteristic <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ i$" border="0" height="16" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img2.png" title="$ i$" width="11" /></span> , <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p_{ij}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img3.png" title="$ p_{ij}$" width="26" /></span> the probability of having <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ i$" border="0" height="16" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img4.png" title="$ i$" width="11" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ j$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img5.png" title="$ j$" width="14" /></span> and so on then he introduces the notation <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = \sum p_i, \quad S_2 = \sum p_{ij}, \quad S_3 = \sum p_{ijh},$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img6.png" title="$ S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = \sum p_i, \quad S_2 = \sum p_{ij}, \quad S_3 = \sum p_{ijh},$" width="412" /></span> ... Then writing <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P_r$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img7.png" title="$ P_r$" width="24" /></span> for the probability of exactly <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img8.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> events</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle P_0 \leq 1 , P_0 \geq 1 - S_1, P_0 \leq 1 - S_1 + S_2, P_0 \geq 1 - S_1 + S_2 - S_3 $" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img9.png" title="$\displaystyle P_0 \leq 1 , P_0 \geq 1 - S_1, P_0 \leq 1 - S_1 + S_2, P_0 \geq 1 - S_1 + S_2 - S_3 $" width="501" /></div>
<p>and so on. The first of these inequalities is due to Boole (q.v.) in 1854. It is the highlighting of Boole's Inequality by Francesco Paolo Cantelli (1875-1966) as a tool for treating statistical dependence at the International Congress of Mathematicians held at Bologna in 1928, which Bonferroni attended, that may have led Bonferroni to produce the elegant pattern of the other members of the sequence. Attribution to Boole is in fact made on pp. 4 and 25 of Bonferroni's paper , in which the inequalities are justified in “symbolic" fashion". Similar ideas using <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ S_k$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img10.png" title="$ S_k$" width="24" /></span> 's were pursued by Károly Jordan (q.v.) and Henri Poincaré.</p>
<p>The inequalities achieved their popularity through a book of Maurice Fréchet (q.v), a frequent correspondent of Cantelli's, of 1940; and William Feller's celebrated <i>An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications,</i>, Vol.1, first published in 1950, which was probably the source for most English speaking readers, It is interesting to note that he cites only the monograph by Fréchet.</p>
<p>The inequalities have given rise to a large literature. The first two have been used in particular in simultaneous statistical inference. The method known as Bonferroni adjustment usually relies only on Boole's Inequality.</p>
<p>Bonferroni's 1936 article uses the classical definition of probability, in terms of a finite sample space of equally likely events, usually attributed to Laplace (q.v.). His notion of probability was not, however, confined to this. In his inaugural address for the academic year (1924-25) published in 1927 he clearly states:</p>
<blockquote>A weight is determined directly by a balance. And a probability, how is that determined? What is, so to say, the probability balance? It is the study of frequencies which gives rise to a specific probability (p. 32)</blockquote>
<p>Then he moves on to consider long run frequency in more detail. On p. 35 he specifically denies that subjective probability is amenable to mathematical analysis.</p>
<p>After these papers he moved away from writing on the foundations of probability. A reason for this change of direction could have been the appearance of the work of von Mises (q.v.) now often regarded as a landmark in the development of the frequentist view.</p>
<p>Bonferroni also worked in a number of other statistical areas. A competitor to the well-known Gini (q.v.) index of concentration, Bonferroni's concentration index is designed to measure income inequality. Let <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x_{(i)}$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img11.png" title="$ x_{(i)}$" width="31" /></span> be the observed <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ i$" border="0" height="16" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img12.png" title="$ i$" width="11" /></span> th order statistic in a sample of size <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img13.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> , so that <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x_{(i-1)} \le x_{(i)} \quad(i=2, \dots, n)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img14.png" title="$ x_{(i-1)} \le x_{(i)} \quad(i=2, \dots, n)$" width="228" /></span> . Define <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ m_i, i=1,2,...,n$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img15.png" title="$ m_i, i=1,2,...,n$" width="137" /></span> , as the sample partial means, so that <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ m=m_n$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img16.png" title="$ m=m_n$" width="72" /></span> is the ordinary sample mean, by:</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle m_i = \frac{1}{i}\sum_{j=1}^{i}x_{(j)}, \ i=1,2,...n. $" border="0" height="76" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img17.png" title="$\displaystyle m_i = \frac{1}{i}\sum_{j=1}^{i}x_{(j)}, \ i=1,2,...n. $" width="240" /></div>
<p>Then Bonferroni's index <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ B_n$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img18.png" title="$ B_n$" width="28" /></span> is</p>

<p>He was also interested in “algebraic" means which he treats extensively in his textbook, <i>Elementi di Statistica Generale</i>. The algebraic mean <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ M_p$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img20.png" title="$ M_p$" width="30" /></span> of order <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img21.png" title="$ p$" width="14" /></span> is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \sqrt[p]{\frac{x_1^p + \dots + x_2^p} {n}}$" border="0" height="59" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img22.png" title="$ \sqrt[p]{\frac{x_1^p + \dots + x_2^p} {n}}$" width="90" /></span> . He published on the properties of a generalisation of this <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ M_{p+q}$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img23.png" title="$ M_{p+q}$" width="47" /></span> defined as <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \sqrt[p+q] {\frac{x_1^p x_2^q + x_1^q x_2^p + \dots} {n(n-1)}}$" border="0" height="56" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/8/l2h/img24.png" title="$ \sqrt[p+q] {\frac{x_1^p x_2^q + x_1^q x_2^p + \dots} {n(n-1)}}$" width="133" /></span> and similarly for higher orders.</p>
<p>One reason for his current lack of recognition may be the fact that his books were never properly disseminated. Apart from <i>Elementi di analisi matematica</i>, and that only in its last edition of 1957, and a smaller research monograph: <i>Sulla correlazione e sulla connessione</i> (1942), they probably do not exist in typeset versions. One of the volumes, <i>Elementi di Statistica Generale</i> was reprinted in facsimile after his death at the instigation of the Faculty of Economics of University of Firenze; bound with it is a memoir by de Finetti. The reason his books were never properly typeset is that he believed that books were too expensive for students to buy, and so to hold costs down he handwrote his teaching material, and had the books printed from that version. (This pattern is reasserting itself for the same reasons with the aid of electronic publishing.) They run to hundreds of pages, neat and almost correction free. His articles have a clear explanatory nature. He was someone with a genuine interest in communicating his ideas to his audience.<br />

<p><b>Émile BOREL</b><br />
b. 7 January 1871 - d. 3 February 1956<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. After his celebrated contributions to pure mathematics, Borel militated in support of the calculus of probabilities all his life. He gave impetus to work on almost sure convergence.</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Émile Borel was born in Saint-Affrique, in the department of the Aveyron (southern Massif Central), France, and died in Paris. He began his studies at the private school run by his father, the pastor of Saint-Affrique, and continued them at Montauban and then Paris, where he made a great impression with his scholastic successes.</p>
<p>At the age of 18, he won the first prize for mathematics in the `Concours general' (competitive examination) and was selected as the top candidate at both the École Polytechnique and the École Normale Supérieure, like Darboux, Picard and Hadamard before him. On the advice of Darboux, he chose to attend the second. This was considered an ideal career path in the closed world of French Universities at the end of the 19th century. He attended Hermite's and Poincaré's courses at the Sorbonne; both were to have a profound influence on his scientific life. It was due to Hermite that he was initiated “into the redoubtable and sacred mysteries of the divinity of number”; this grew into a deep love of mathematics, a youthful love which would never leave him. From Poincaré he absorbed an openness of mind, a feeling for the unity and universality of scientific culture at the highest level, the “objective value of Science”, even though Borel soon found himself opposed to Poincaré's fundamental scepticism. Poincaré, knowing everything about everything, knew better then most “that we know nothing”.</p>
<p>Like many young mathematicians of his generation, Borel was deeply influenced by both Cantorian “romanticism” and Weierstrassian “discipline”. In 1894 he defended a dazzling thesis in which he used the Cantorian theory of (linear) sets which are now called after him, to break the confines into which Weierstrass had enclosed analytic function theory, and showed the potential richness of the concept of a set of points of measure zero in the theory of functions. Borelian theory of functions, which he taught the young `Normaliens' at the end of the 19th century, including Baire and Lebesgue, was soon to infiltrate all real analysis.</p>
<p>In 1893, even before defending his thesis, he was appointed maître de conférences (lecturer) in the Faculty of Sciences at Lille, and in 1897 at the École Normale Supérieure, and then the University of Paris in 1904. In 1909 he became a full professor appointed to a Chair in the Theory of Functions specially created for him. At the same time, he held the post of Assistant Director of the École Normale Supérieure between 1910 and 1920. He remained a professor in the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Paris until his retirement in 1941.</p>
<p>In April 1906, in <i>La Revue du Mois</i>, the monthly periodical which he had just founded, Borel defined in a specific manner the new scientific programme which he intended to follow thereafter, namely “The practical worth of the calculus of probabilities”. Borel at once disposed of one of the principal interpretations of the calculus of probabilities, which the 19th century had accepted as a last resort . This was the double meaning (double nature or double origin) of probability, in that it could be “subjective" or “objective". Borel wrote “There is no difference in nature between objective and subjective probability, only a difference of degree. A result in the calculus of probabilities deserves to be called objective, when the probability is sufficiently large to be practically equivalent to certainty. It matters little whether one is predicting future events or reviewing past events; one may equally aver that a probabilistic law will be, or has been, confirmed."</p>
<p>Borel's eventual position on the double nature of probability evolved very slightly after the appearance of Keynes' (q.v.) (1921) treatise on probabilities, in which Keynes adapted a subjectivist-logical position. Borel distanced himself from it, judging that “if Keynes is correct from the theoretical point of view, Poincaré's opinion is practically justified and exact.” Borel's thinking was no doubt fairly close to this austere dualism: theoretical subjectivity-practical objectivity.</p>
<p>Simultaneously Borel published, one after the other, two mathematical papers on the calculus of probabilities. The first, in 1905, explained how Borel measure allowed one to extend and make more precise the calculation of “geometric probabilities”. The second was more ambitious: it attempted to show that the calculus of probabilities, while certainly playing an interesting role in human affairs, could also explain the paradoxes of statistical physics. Thus, even adopting Poincaré's viewpoint of science pursued for its own sake, the calculus of probabilities could shed light on some of its darkest shadows, namely those surrounding the kinetic theory of gases.</p>
<p>The only possibility open to a scholar was to reason probabilistically and to seek, as in a game of heads or tails, those motions among all the possible ones which were the most probable, particularly as these rapidly become the only ones physically possible. As is well known, Borel put forward the parable of the monkey typists to give an idea of the extreme improbability of a small deviation from the most probable configurations. It is easier for an army of monkeys typing on the keyboards of typewriters, to compose all the books in all the libraries of the world, than for a mixture of two initially separate gases to return, by the random collision of their molecules, to their initial states.</p>
<p>The <i>Revue du Mois</i> having proclaimed (the first in the world to do so) both the practical and scientific values of the calculus of probabilities, there remained for its director only to pursue the good fight wherever he could. Borel did so initially at the Sorbonne where he gave his first course on the calculus of probabilities in 1908-1909, the same year that he had been appointed as full professor to the Chair of the Theory of Functions. In the same year 1909, Borel took an active part in the Congress of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) held in Paris, campaigning to regain a place for the application of the calculus of probabilities to statistics. Until then, the ISI had concentrated on official statistics.</p>
<p>In the same year, 1909, Borel published a classical work in the mathematical theory of probability, on “denumerable probabilities". The so-called Borel-Cantelli Lemma originates in this work. In this paper, for the first time, it was stated and (almost) proved that the sequence of relative frequencies of tails, in an indefinite sequence (“denumerable”) of games of heads and tails, converges to the probability of a tail in a single trial, except for a set of games of probability zero. This statement was to accelerate appreciably the rather slow development of probability theory, and may without exaggeration be considered the starting point of modern probability, giving it a new dimension, embodied in almost sure convergence, and Borel sets of probability measure zero.</p>
<p>Borel's article was also read by mathematicians, partly because it contains statements on the theory of numbers which were of immediate current mathematical interest, particularly the first among them. This was that the set of real numbers on the unit interval consists almost surely of normal numbers, the frequencies of each of the digits in their expression (in any base whatever) being asymptotically equal with probability 1, if the digits are drawn at random one after the other. As Borel said, and Lebesgue further explicated to him, the set of normal numbers has the Borel measure 1. This article contains a second application to the theory of numbers, an account of the properties of the sequence of digits in the continued fraction expansion of a number drawn at random from the unit segment.</p>
<p>Did Borel train a French “school” of probabilists? Any reply to this question must be qualified. As a humanistic scholar, Borel elevated the calculus of probabilities to the highest level, possibly too high a level; as a mathematician, he set it too low. Borel thought that mathematicians should first train themselves in mathematics by studying the great mathematical theories (for example, the theory of functions). He thought that the calculus of probabilities was somewhat remote from the “great problems”, such as those of Hermite, Darboux or Poincaré. What is more, and rather paradoxically, Borel was not very interested in the axiomatisation of probabilities.</p>
<p>The First World War oriented Borel's activities even more towards applications. France was in danger, and the scientific community mobilised itself to defend and protect it from “German barbarism”. Painlevé, who had entered the political arena after the Dreyfus affair, was elected deputy for Paris in 1910, and was entrusted in 1915 with the direction of the large ministry of Public Education, Arts and Inventions relevant to National Defence. Within the latter, he created the Directorate for inventions in the service of National Defence, and named Borel “Head of the Technical Office” . When Painlevé was Minister for War from March to September 1917, Borel was Director of the Ministry's Technical Services, and when Painlevé rose to the Presidency of the Council at the most tragic moment of the war in the autumn of 1917, Borel was the general Secretary of the government, entrusted with all missions, both possible and impossible, including those connected with the scientific aspects of the war. He later became deputy for the department of the Aveyron from 1924 to 1936, mayor of Saint-Affrique from 1929 to 1941 and from 1945 to 1947, and Minister for the Navy in 1925.</p>
<p>Borel's political activities did not prevent him from devoting some of his time to new “flashes” of inspiration in the theory of probability, particularly on the theory of games (1920) or queues (1942). It was also he, together with Lucien March, Director of the Statistique Générale de la France (French Statistical Bureau) and Fernand Faure, holder of the Chair of Statistics in the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris (the first such chair in France, founded in 1892), who was responsible for the creation of the Institut de Statistique de l'Université de Paris, an institute serving the four faculties of the University of Paris (Law, Literature, Medicine, Sciences), which starting in 1922 was to train the competent statisticians necessary for Borel's France.</p>
<p>At the same time, Borel launched a new series with Gauthier-Villars (the publishers) of which he was the sole editor. This was the <i>Traité du Calcul des Probabilités et de ses Applications</i>, which consisted of 5 volumes and 18 fascicles published between 1925 and 1939, five of these being written by Borel himself. This was an important work, which fell fairly rapidly into relative obscurity after the war. The great treatises on probability published directly after the war, namely those of Cramér (q.v.), Doob, Feller, Loève, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \ldots$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/10/l2h/img1.png" title="$ \ldots$" width="27" /></span> , resolutely adopted an expository style which set the pattern for the mathematical works of the time and thereafter: explicit axioms, precise enunciations, full proofs in a logical order. Yet one knows very well since Cournot (q.v.), that this is neither the rational nor the practical order, which was why Borel had rejected it.<br />

<p><b>Ladislaus von BORTKIEWICZ</b><br />
b. 7 August 1868 - d. 15 July 1931</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Bortkiewicz did more than investigate kicks by Prussian cavalry horses. A pioneer faithful to his master Lexis, he extended in numerous and original ways ways the application of the probability calculus to statistical problems.</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Bortkiewicz was born into a Polish family in St.Petersburg, capital of the Russian Empire. “Bortkiewicz" is the Polish spelling of his surname, and most of his works are written under this spelling. The German tranliteration from the Russian version is “Bortkewitsch", under which he wrote his best known work <i>Das Gesetz der kleinen Zahlen (The Law of Small Numbers.)</i> An English transliteration of his surname from the Russian is “Bortkevich", with emphasis on the “ke". Correspondingly, his first name is variously given as Wladyslaw, Ladislaus, and Vladislav. All three of his identifications: Polish, German and Russian are evident in his life, contacts and writings. His father Joseph Ivanowitsch Bortkewitsch, an aristocrat from Kaunas, now in Lithuania, but then a city of the Russian Empire called Kovno, was a colonel who was also an instructor in artillery and in mathematics, and had written several texts in mathematics, and other works in economics and finance. His mother was Helene von Rokicka.</p>
<p>Bortkiewicz pursued his studies in the Faculty of Law of the University of St. Petersburg, from which he graduated in 1890; he left to improve his training in statistics and political economy in Germany. After spending a short time at the university of Strasburg (1891-1892), where he worked under the direction of Georg Friedrich Knapp (1842-1926), then at Göttingen with Wilhelm Lexis (q.v.), and also at Vienna and Leipzig, he defended his doctoral thesis at the University of Göttingen in 1893. From 1895 to 1897 he taught actuarial studies and theoretical statistics as a <i>Privatdozent</i> at the University of Strasburg (the title page of the <i>Gesetz</i> describes him in this capacity), where he influenced A.A.Chuprov (q.v.). He returned to Russia in 1897, before coming back permanently to Germany four years later. While employed in the general office of the Pensions Committee for the railways in St. Petersburg between 1897 and 1901, he also taught statistics from 1899 until December 1900 at the prestigious Alexandrovsky Lyceum. In 1901, he was appointed professor <i>extraordinarius</i> (Associate Professor) at the University of Berlin, where he remained until his death in 1931. From 1906 to 1923, he taught simultaneously at the Handelshochschule of Berlin as a <i>Privatdozent</i>. It was only after the introduction of university reforms under the Weimar republic that Bortkiewicz was promoted to the rank of professor <i>ordinarius</i>, (full Professor) and then merely <i>ad personam</i> in statistics and political economy. The Chair remained vacant after his death; Bortkiewicz would have liked Gumbel (q.v.) to succeed him, but the latter was marginalized by his anti-nationalist activities, which earned him the hostility of the Berlin establishment. Thus the Chair remained vacant for the entire period of the Third Reich. The short biography of Bortkiewicz by Gumbel (1978), though politically tendentious, is that of a disciple.</p>
<p>In his generation, Bortkiewicz was the main representative of mathematical statistics in Germany and within the sphere of German influence. Scrupulous in the extreme, inclined to be critical and polemical, Bortkiewicz was a highly respected and feared figure; but he was rarely understood, so that his teaching as well as his published work had few imitators. Yet, this work ranges from political economy to probability, through demography, actuarial studies, economic statistics and statistical physics. His published works are mainly in German, although a number, beginning in 1890 are in Russian; and three or so are in Polish.</p>
<p>Bortkiewicz contributed in a decisive manner to the modern development of mathematical statistics, taking up the inheritance of Laplace (q.v.), Poisson (q.v.), Bienaymé (q.v.), Cournot (q.v.) and finally Lexis (q.v.).</p>
<p>Demography and actuarial studies were still the dominant core of statistics at the end of the 19th century, and these were Botkiewicz's first areas of research in Russia and Germany. This research was an extension of the work of his two German masters, Knapp in “theoretical demography" and Lexis in matters concerning the study of mortality and births. Bortkiewicz lectured widely, including at the Congress of the International Statistical Institute, on his methods and on his results on the treatment of tables, as well as on the male ratio at birth.</p>
<p>Posthumous fame was ensured by his short work, the <i>Gesetz</i> of 1898, dedicated to Lexis, in which he discussed his famous (but widely misunderstood subsequently) “Law of Small Numbers". In this pamphlet he gave the first account and application of the distribution of rare events, established sixty years earlier by Poisson. What is usually remembered is his famous example on the number of men killed by horse kicks in the Prussian army. But on a less superficial level, Bortkiewicz's book may be interpreted as a twofold plea. First, by giving theoretical proofs and many numerical examples, Bortkiewicz consolidated Lexis's theory based on his famous Q coefficient of dispersion. He proved that rare events whose frequency is low have a sufficiently regular dispersion to satisfy Lexis's criterion (Q close to 1). This achieved, Bortkiewicz provided the first major validation of Lexis's idea, raising it, somewhat clumsily, to the level of a “Law of small numbers". This title was used to recall, rather than contrast with Poisson's “Law of Large Numbers". His success opened up a far more ambitious perspective. While Lexis's theory provided a simultaneous measure of the stability of statistical series and a criterion for the applicability of probabilistic models, the contribution of Bortkiewicz was essentially a plea for the use of probabilistic methods in the treatment of statistical data. On this score, his work did not fail to trigger some violent and contradictory reactions. One was with <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.) over the Lucy Whitaker paper (Quine and Seneta, 1987). These controversies lasted well after World War I and were followed from time to time by others, particularly one with Gini (q.v.) concerning priority.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, German statistics, inheriting a long administrative tradition with all its history, was still thoroughly divided on the meaning and existence of social laws established mathematically. The ghost of Quetelet (q.v.) still haunted statistical thinking when Bortkiewicz's work appeared. All the old mistrust concerning advanced mathematics, and even more acutely the aim of basing all statistics on the calculus of probabilities, then resurfaced.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Bortkiewicz never ceased to defend Lexis' theory. Many of his publications were related to the study of dispersio;n which may be regarded as one of the central themes of his work. Together with Markov (q.v.) and Chuprov in particular, Bortkiewicz tried to develop, perhaps in vain, the basis of a real analysis of variance starting from Lexis' theory, but this direction taken by continental statisticians was not followed up, in contrast to the English Biometric School. While Chuprov, Bortkiewicz's friend and rival, was able to redirect his research and recognize the innovations of the English School, Bortkiewicz for too long allowed himself to be entangled in his interminable quarrels; another with Karl Pearson was about the Chi-square distribution, which Bortkiewicz attributed quite correctly to Helmert.</p>
<p>There remains, however, an area where Bortkiewicz's thinking found a happier outlet: extremes and order statistics. One may set his pioneering contribution to the study of extreme values of 1922 within the framework of his research on dispersion. Starting from the comments of Fechner on the range, he pursued an argument analogous to that which had led him to the “Law of Small Numbers" and showed that the range, showed a remarkable regularity, similar to that of rare events. His results and comments, echoing the research carried out by the School of his old adversary Karl Pearson, would later be discussed and fruitfully extended by his younger German colleagues R. von Mises (q.v.), and particularly Gumbel, amongst others.</p>
<p>Bortkiewicz took an interest in every possible application of the calculus of probabilities, and had a predilection for intricate problems. In a pamphlet published in 1913, he considered the question of radioactive radiation, and showed that its distribution followed probabilistic laws.</p>
<p>In the 1920s Bortkiewicz concerned himself with questions of economic statistics; the concentration of wealth, which resulted in a new quarrel with the Italian Gini within the International Statistical Institute. In 1923-24 his critical review of the treatise by <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=50" name="menu1">Irving Fisher</a> (q.v.) on <i>Price Index Numbers</i> again started yet another controversy.</p>
<p>Overall, there is only a single area where his name is as familiar as at the dawn of the 20th century, namely Political Economy. Like all statisticians trained in German universities at the end of the 19th century, Bortkiewicz had acquired a taste for economics, and demonstrated it by a remarkably astute study of Book III of <i>Das Kapital</i> in which Marx discussed his theory of the transformation of value into price. This work warranted Bortkiewicz being ranked by Schumpeter (1951) as “one of the ten greatest economists from Marx to Keynes" and</p>
<blockquote>“By far his most important achievement is his analysis of the theoretical framework of the Marxian system, much the best thing ever written on it and, incidentally, on its other critics."</blockquote>
<p>Bortkiewicz maintained active contacts with Polish scientists, notably Neyman (q.v.), and was sounded out on accepting a Chair at the University of Warsaw, and in Kraków. There is a posthumous survey of his work by Neyman - who regards Bortkiewicz's <i>Die Iterationen</i> (1917) as his most important work - followed by an anonymous obituary, both in Polish, in <i>Kwartalnik Statystyczny</i>, <b>8</b>(1931), 1116-1120.</p>
<p>A systematic study of Bortkiewicz as a statistician would throw valuable light on this crucial period in the history of mathematical statistics.<br />

<p><b>Rogerius Josephus BOSCOVICH</b><br />

<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Rogerius Josephus Boscovich was a Jesuit priest from Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, who developed in 1760 a simple geometrical method of fitting a straight line to a set of observations on two variables using (constrained) least sum of absolute deviations. This procedure was subsequently popularised in an algebraic form by Laplace.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Rogerius Josephus Boscovich (Italian: Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich; Croatian: Rugjer (or Rudjer) Josip Bošković) was born in Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia), the sixth son of a merchant's agent. He was educated at the (Jesuit) <i>Collegium Ragusinum</i> in Ragusa and at the (Jesuit) <i>Collegium Romanum</i> in Rome (Italy), but long before he had completed his training as a Jesuit priest he discovered his vocation as a teacher of mathematics. Indeed, in 1740 he succeeded his own teacher as professor of mathematics at the <i>Collegium Romanum</i>. In the years following 1743 Boscovich was employed by Pope Benedict XIV as an adviser on a variety of mathematical problems. In particular, in 1750-1752 Boscovich and the English Jesuit Christopher Maire were commissioned to measure an arc of the meridian in the vicinity of Rome and to prepare a new geographical map of the Papal States. A detailed account of this geodetic survey was published by Maire and Boscovich in 1755 and a summary by Boscovich alone in 1757.</p>
<p>The Seven Years War of 1756-1763 was fought between Britain, Hanover and Prussia on one side and Austria and France on the other, and resulted in the loss of the French territories of Québec and Maine in North America. This war brought Boscovich's skills as a diplomat into play. In 1758 he was sent to Vienna (Austria) and in 1760 to Paris (France) and London (England). During his visit to London, Boscovich finalised his notes for the second volume of the poem in Latin hexameters by his fellow Ragusan Benedikt Stay. He also met many leading members of the Royal Society of London and took the opportunity of proposing a geodetic expedition to North America. Later, in 1767, Boscovich was invited to participate in the 1769 astronomical expedition to California, but his invitation was withdrawn when the organisers discovered that Jesuits were strictly excluded from Spanish territory in the Americas.</p>
<p>The Jesuit Order was suppressed throughout the world in 1773. however Boscovich managed to secure a pension from King Louis XV of France which lasted until his death in Milan (Italy) in 1787.</p>
<p>Boscovich made significant contributions to a wide range of scientific disciplines, his principal contribution being the first modern treatise on the atomic theory of matter. For detailed discussions of his scientific work, see Bursill-Hall (1994) and Whyte (1961). Here we shall be concerned with Boscovich's development of the first <i>objective</i> procedure for fitting a linear relationship to a set of observations. [The earlier procedure of Tobias Mayer is not objective as the classification of the observations into groups clearly depends on the criterion employed in their classification.]</p>
<p>The fundamental mathematical problem which Boscovich addressed in his section of Maire and Boscovich (1755, pp. 497-503; 1770, pp. 479-484), in Boscovich (1757, pp. 391-392; 1961, pp. 88-93) and in his notes to Stay (1760, pp. 420-425; 1770, pp. 501-510) was that of determining the values of the coefficients <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img1.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img2.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> which best fit <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img3.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> equations of the form</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle y_i=a+bx_i\quad i=1,2,\ldots ,n $" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img4.png" title="$\displaystyle y_i=a+bx_i\quad i=1,2,\ldots ,n $" width="232" /></div>
<p>The problem explicitly addressed by Boscovich in his 1755 and 1757 studies concerned his attempt to reconcile the ten distinct values <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ % b_{ij}=(y_i-y_j)/(x_i-x_j)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img5.png" title="$ % b_{ij}=(y_i-y_j)/(x_i-x_j)$" width="199" /></span> which he had obtained for the slope coefficient by solving the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n=5$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img6.png" title="$ n=5$" width="50" /></span> equations two at a time. In 1755 Boscovich had no firm idea of what to do with these ten values. He first took an unweighted average of all ten values, and then an average of the eight values which remained after he had deleted the two with smallest denominators. However, in 1757 he formulated the principle that the values of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img7.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img8.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> should be chosen in such a way that the errors</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle e_i=y_i-a-bx_i\quad i=1,2,\ldots ,n $" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img9.png" title="$\displaystyle e_i=y_i-a-bx_i\quad i=1,2,\ldots ,n $" width="269" /></div>
should sum to zero and have minimum absolute sum.
<p>From the adding-up condition, <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \sum e_i = 0$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img10.png" title="$ \sum e_i = 0$" width="77" /></span> , we find that <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img11.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> is related to <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img12.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> by <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ a = {\bar y} - b{\bar x}$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img13.png" title="$ a = {\bar y} - b{\bar x}$" width="91" /></span> where <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \bar x = \sum x_i/n$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img14.png" title="$ \bar x = \sum x_i/n$" width="100" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \bar y = \sum y_i/n$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img15.png" title="$ \bar y = \sum y_i/n$" width="98" /></span> . Substituting this expression into the optimality condition, we find that we have to minimise <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \sum\vert(y_i - {\bar y}) - b(x_i - {\bar x})\vert$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img16.png" title="$ \sum\vert(y_i - {\bar y}) - b(x_i - {\bar x})\vert$" width="197" /></span> , that is, we have to find the weighted median of the ratios <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ b_i^{*} = (y_i - {\bar y})/(x_i - {\bar x})\;\;i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img17.png" title="$ b_i^{*} = (y_i - {\bar y})/(x_i - {\bar x})\;\;i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$" width="304" /></span> .</p>
<p>Boscovich did not explain how this problem could be solved in his 1757 summary but merely gave the results of the calculations. However, in his commentary to Stay's poem he showed how the ratios may be calculated and arranged in decreasing order by means of a geometrical procedure. This geometrical procedure takes the form of a cartesian diagram with axes <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x = 0$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img18.png" title="$ x = 0$" width="50" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ y = 0$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img19.png" title="$ y = 0$" width="49" /></span> in which the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img20.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> points <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (x_i, y_i) \;\;i = 1, 2,\ldots, n$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img21.png" title="$ (x_i, y_i) \;\;i = 1, 2,\ldots, n$" width="180" /></span> have been plotted together with a movable line. This movable line starts in the vertical position <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x = \bar x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img22.png" title="$ x = \bar x$" width="51" /></span> and rotates in a clockwise direction about the centroid <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (\bar x, \bar y)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img23.png" title="$ (\bar x, \bar y)$" width="48" /></span> . As it moves, the line passes through each of the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img24.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> points in turn and identifies the successive ratios in decreasing order. The weighted median of these ratios, and hence the minimal value of the absolute error function <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \sum \vert e_i\vert$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img25.png" title="$ \sum \vert e_i\vert$" width="53" /></span> , is identified by evaluating the cumulative sum of the weights <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \vert x_i - {\bar x}\vert \;\; i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img26.png" title="$ \vert x_i - {\bar x}\vert \;\; i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$" width="188" /></span> in the order determined by the moving line, and choosing the point for which this cumulative sum first equals or exceeds one-half of the sum of all <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img27.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> such terms.</p>
<p>Boscovich's use of geometrical terminology in this context was disapprobated by Laplace (q.v.) who translated his procedure into an algebraic format in 1793. Nevertheless, it should be noted that Boscovich probably obtained the ideas embodied in his solution procedure from a geometrical diagram of this type. the restricted variant of this procedure discussed by Boscovich and Laplace was subsequently generalised to any number of explanatory variables (with or without the adding-up constraint) by Gauss (q.v.) in 1809. However, Gauss seems to have made no further use of the procedure after that date. See Farebrother (1987) for an account of the later history of this <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ L_1$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img28.png" title="$ L_1$" width="25" /></span> procedure (subsequently renamed the method of situation by Laplace) and the closely related minimax absolute error or <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ L_\infty $" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img29.png" title="$ L_\infty $" width="32" /></span> procedure. More recently, the <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ L_1$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/12/l2h/img30.png" title="$ L_1$" width="25" /></span> procedure has served as the basis of a wide class of robust fitting procedures.</p>
<p>Boscovich has been severely criticised by later writers for choosing to publish some of his original scientific work in the notes to Stay's poem. Even if we allow that he could write in Latin with ease, it seems inconceivable that he should have chosen to devote so much of his spare time to writing a detailed commentary on a poem in Latin hexameters. However, this is precisely what he did choose to do. Further, it seems reasonable to conjecture that Boscovich would have thought that this manner of spending his leisure time compared very favourably with that employed by his wealthier contemporaries (not to mention present-day statisticians).<br />

<p><b>Arthur Lyon BOWLEY</b><br />
b. 6 November 1869 - d. 21 January 1957<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Inspired by an early acquaintance with socialists and slums, Bowley, a pioneer in the development of statistical tools for the analysis of matters of economic and social concern, is remembered for his development of sampling techniques as applied in the social sciences.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Questions of foreign trade, wages, poverty, industry, the national income and the general welfare of the citizens of a country have long been of concern to governments. It was only with the development of appropriate statistical tools in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, however, that the analysis of such matters was placed on a more scientific footing. Bowley was one of the pioneers in the development and use of such tools.</p>
<p>The son of James William Lyon Bowley and his second wife Maria Johnson, Arthur Lyon Bowley was born in Bristol, England, where his father was vicar of SS Philip and Jacob. James died in 1870, and Maria was left as mother (or step-mother) to seven children. From 1879 to 1888 the young Arthur (so named because of his mother's fondness for the works of Tennyson) was educated at Christ's Hospital, London, where he won various prizes for classics and mathematics. In later life Bowley pleasurably renewed his ties with the school as a representative of the University of London on the Council of Almoners from 1936 to 1947, being <i>ipso facto</i> a governor during that period.</p>
<p>A major scholarship in mathematics took him to Trinity College, Cambridge, where, despite poor health (so poor, in fact, that a trip to Egypt, financed by several dons, had to be taken, and this was followed by a lengthy stay in the more bracing atmosphere of Bournemouth), he was bracketed tenth Wrangler in 1891. His previous ill health necessitated his spending a further term in residence before the degree could be awarded, and so from October 1891 to March 1892 Bowley studied physics, chemistry and economics, following a reading course in the latter under the supervision of Alfred Marshall.</p>
<p>In 1892 Bowley's early interest in economics and statistics was publicly recognized in the award of the Cobden Prize for his essay <i>A Short Account of England's Foreign Trade in the Nineteenth Century</i>, and two years later he was awarded the Adam Smith Prize for a paper on changes in average wages.</p>
<p>A bequest of £9,000 from Henry Hunt Hutchison to the Fabian Society in 1895 enabelled Sidney and Beatrice Webb, together with like-minded individuals, to found the London School of Economics. Among the part-time lecturers at the start of the first session in October of that year was Bowley (appointed on Marshall's recommendation), who was charged with the giving of lectures in statistics. Bowley fulfilled his obligations by cycling some eighteen miles from St John's School, Leatherhead, where he was a teacher of mathematics, on the afternoons of his Wednesday half-holidays.</p>
<p>On taking up his lectureship, Bowley consulted F.Y. Edgeworth (q.v.) for information on the nature and literature of statistics, starting a friendship which lasted until Edgeworth's death. The lectureship became a Readership in 1908, and in 1915 Bowley was given the title “Professor", becoming, in 1919, the first incumbent of the University of London's newly-created Chair in Statistics, tenable at the London School of Economics. It was on receiving this full-time post that he left his position at University College, Reading, where he had been lecturer in mathematics (1900-1907), in economics (1913-1919) and professor in both (1907-1913). Bowley remained at the London School of Economics until 1936, when he became emeritus professor. But his energy and enthusiasm continued after retirement: he carried on with a number of his activities at the London School of Economics, and from 1940 to 1944 he was acting (and an active) director of the Oxford University Institute of Statistics.</p>
<p>While Bowley may have started his working life as a teacher of mathematics, his two prize essays and the start of a long series of papers (many co-authored with G.H. Wood) in 1898 clearly showed the way of his future career. As a boy Bowley had been acquainted with socialists and slum conditions in Bristol, and at Trinity College he tried, though with indifferent success, to further social equality by entertaining the dining-hall waiters to light refreshments and conversation. Indeed, the contrast between Bristol slums and Trinity wealth did much to sharpen his interest in socialism, and although Bowley never become a socialist in the sense in which the Webbs did, he channelled his liberal concept of progress into his research.</p>
<p>Bowley's Cobden Prize essay was published as a book in 1893. Intending this as an introductory text to provide the reader with easy access to the “fundamental facts of this century's commerce", Bowley set out the more important events and causes affecting the growth of trade with their due prominence, and indicated the more obvious of the social effects of this growth. (One notes, with approval, Bowley's especial use of the comparative degree.) Here tables of figures were largely eschewed, being replace by diagrams.</p>
<p>The Adam Smith Prize essay, in a revised form, was presented to the Royal Statistical Society in 1895, and resulted in the award of the Guy Medal in Silver (the Guy Medal in Gold followed in 1935). Here Bowley found the actual changes in the total sum paid in wages and the average money wage, the changes in the gross receipts of profits and interest, and the income of the nation as a whole. Special features were (a) statements of wages were never compared unless they were given by the same authority and (b) ratios, rather than amounts, of wages were considered. The paper is an excellent example of what such a study should be, and it can still be read with profit and enjoyment. Indeed, if some of Bowley's work today seems hackneyed or trite, it is only because it has become commonplace.</p>
<p>Bowley's statistical lectures at the London School of Economics resulted in two text-books. The first of these, <i>Elements of Statistics</i> (1901), was intended primarily for those wishing to understand, appraise and criticize official and similar statistics, this word being understood as “the science of the measurement of the social organism, regarded as a whole, in all its manifestations". The contents range from the collection and tabulation of data through moments, graphical methods, correlation and index numbers (in Part 1), to the application of mathematics to statistics (in Part 11), the examples in this part being chosen principally with reference to sociological and economic investigations.</p>
<p>The <i>Elementary Manual of Statistics</i> of 1910 is less demanding of the reader: it is concerned more with official than mathematical statistics, the Index leading from “Abatements, income-tax" via the “Panama Canal" to “Zinc production".</p>
<p>In 1913 Bowley published <i>A General Course of Pure Mathematics</i>. Designed for those who used “pure mathematics as an instrument in mechanics, engineering, physics, chemistry and economics", this work met with a mixed reception, being received with enthusiasm by E.T. Whittaker but somewhat more coldly by G.H. Hardy.</p>
<p>Bowley's <i>Mathematical Groundwork of Economics</i> of 1924 was a laudable attempt to present, in a unified form, the mathematical methods used by some of his economic predecessors. Unlike his mathematical and statistical texts, however, it was intended for the practising (professional) economist rather than the tiro.</p>
<p>Bowley's pioneering activities in economics were two: the first consisted of a number of studies on the definition and measurement of the national income. while the second was his work with the London and Cambridge Economic Society, which continued until 1953. But his major contribution, as much to statistics as to economics, was his work on the development of sampling techniques as applied in the social sciences.</p>
<p>Until around the turn of the century it was widely held that complete enumeration was the only way to obtain precise results in demographic studies, an attitude criticized by Bowley in his presidential address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1906. Bowley, however, was not one to preach without practising: in 1912 he conducted a sample survey of Reading, one whose design, implementation and analysis still serve as models for such surveys. Similar surveys of Northampton, Warrington and Stanley were conducted by A.R. Burnett-Hurst under Bowley's supervision, and published, together with the Reading survey, in <i>Livelihood and Poverty</i> in 1915. A separatum was issued in 1920, giving the results of a similar survey carried out in Bolton. The results obtained about poverty were both surprising and shocking. The accuracy of the results was subjected to careful criticism, and possible sources of error (and the steps taken to avoid them) were discussed. A follow-up study in 1924 resulted in <i>Has Poverty Diminished?</i>, a question that was answerable in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Bowley's insistence on the importance of sampling (or the representative method, as it was then called) led to his membership of a committee set up by the International Statistical Institute in 1924, and resulted in his report “Measurement of the precision attained in sampling" in which he set out the first clear statement of the foundation of the modern theory of sample surveys. Here Bowley (a) explained the nature and role of a sampling frame, (b) developed a theory for proportionate stratified sampling, and (c) developed a theory for purposive sampling. There is no doubt that the cause of official statistics would have been advanced had bureaurocracy not been obdurate in the acceptance of the wisdom and institution of sampling.</p>
<p>A prominent aspect of this report was the demonstration of the superiority of stratified over simple random sampling, though Bowley was not always careful to distinguish between the latter and cluster, or systematic, sampling. Bowley's continuation with this research culminated in what he himself regarded as his most important work: the <i>New Survey of London Life and Labour</i> undertaken from 1930 to 1935. Bowley in a sense moved out of “pure" economics into econometrics in the path-breaking <i>Family Expenditure</i>, co-authored with R.D.G. Allen in 1935 (when Bowley was sixty-six). Here the expenditures of individual families were compared with those of individuals within families, the goodness-of-fit of an empirically derived linear law being examined by a <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \chi^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/13/l2h/img1.png" title="$ \chi^2$" width="24" /></span> <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">test</a>.</p>
<p>In 1913 Bowley received an Sc.D. from Cambridge, while an honorary D.Litt. (Oxon.) and a D.Sc. (Manchester) followed later. He occupied, at various times, high positions in the Royal Statistical Society, the Royal Economic Society (elected Fellow in 1893), the International Statistical Institute, the Econometric Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science (Section F: economic science and statistics). In 1897-1898 and again in 1927-1928 he was Newmarch Lecturer at University College London. In 1922 he was made a Fellow of the British Academy, in 1937 he was appointed a Commander of the British Empire, and he was knighted in 1950.</p>
<p>In 1904 Bowley married Julia Hilliam, instructress in wood-carving at Reading College, an arithmetic progression of daughters (Ruth, Agatha and Marian) following.</p>
<p>Bowley is painted by those who knew him as “dour" in committees (whether <i>obstinate, sullen or grim</i> I cannot say), a man of discretion, shy and retiring, respected by colleagues and friends but intimate with few. After a life marked by a sincere and sympathetic concern for the human condition, Bowley died on the 21st January 1957 at Haslemere, Surrey.<br />

<p><b>Georges-Louis LECLERC, Comte de BUFFON</b><br />
b. 7 September 1707 - d. 16 April 1788<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b> Author of the monumental <i>Histoire Naturelle</i>, Buffon also introduced several original ideas in probability and statistics, notably the premier example in “geometric probability" and a body of experimental and theoretical work in demography.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Georges-Louis Leclerc was born in Montbard, Burgundy, the son of a councillor in the Burgundian Parliament, who took the title of seigneur de Buffon in 1717. Following his secondary studies at the Jesuit college in Dijon, he studied for a degree in Law, possibly with the aim of following in his father's footsteps, but his interests were more inclined to mathematics. It would appear that he had read the <i>Elements</i> of Euclid, the <i>Analyse des infiniment petits</i> of the Marquis de l'Hôpital, and rediscovered Newton's binomial formula. His early correspondence with Gabriel Cramer (1704-1752), professor of analysis and geometry at the University of Geneva dates back to 1727. Buffon acknowledged that he owed to Cramer “part of his first knowledge" of mathematics, in particular the calculus of probabilities. During a visit to Geneva in 1731, Cramer acquainted him with the problem first posed by Nicolas Bernoulli (q.v.) to Pierre-Rémond de Montmort, commonly known as the St Petersburg problem (Weil, 1961). Buffon suggested a solution which foreshadowed the future concepts of moral expectation and of utility function. In 1728, he moved to Angers, where he attended lectures in medicine. These were interrupted as the result of a duel, and he later studied botany.</p>
<p>In 1733, wishing to demonstrate that “chance falls within the domain of geometry as well as that of analysis" Buffon presented his paper “Solution de problèmes sur le jeu du franc-carreau", to the Académie Royale des Sciences. In it, he applied infinitesimal analysis to the calculus of probabilities, thus initiating the study of geometrical probability. It contains a mention of the “Buffon needle problem" for which his name persists in probability theory.</p>
<p>In January 1734 he was elected Adjunct Member to the Royal Academy in the Mechanics Section; in March 1739 he was transferred to the Botany Section of which he became an Associate Member in June 1739. Meanwhile, his main interests had shifted to forestry (Hanks, 1966), and, more broadly, plant physiology; in 1735, he translated the <i>Vegetable Staticks</i> of Stephen Hales, originally published in English in 1727. In his Preface to this work, Buffon praised the merits of Newton's experimental method, whose fecundity in physics had been demonstrated. Buffon specifically obtained a series of observations, from which he attempted to establish the laws of resistance of wood by a comparable method. However, as Hanks (1966, p.210) points out, these researches suffered from a lack of statistical methods for determining the significance level for the differences between sample observations on the one hand, and the theory and empirical data on the other. It should be pointed out that some years later, in the first volume of his <i>Histoire naturelle</i>, Buffon advocated the use of statistics “when subjects are too complex to allow us to apply to advantage calculations and measurements".</p>
<p>In 1740, he published <i>Méthode des fluxions et des suites infinies</i> a translation of Newton's work after the English text of Colson, with a preface in which he adopted a position on the Leibniz-Newton controversy about the discovery of the infinitesimal calculus, and developed his views on the mathematical notion of infinity. Eight years later, he communicated his <i>Réflexions sur la loi d'attraction</i>, to the Academy, replying to Clairaut's suggestion that Newton's law of gravitation be modified, and got into a controversy on the relation of mathematics to reality.</p>
<p>In July 1739, he was named Superintendent of the King's Garden by his patron, the minister Maurepas, and entrusted with the task of producing an account of the King's Natural History collection. He broadened the project considerably and worked for 10 years in collaboration with Daubenton to write the first volumes of his monumental <i>Histoire naturelle générale et particulière avec la description du Cabinet du Roy</i> consisting of 15 volumes published between 1749 and 1767. It enjoyed great success, and provided Buffon with fame and honours: he became a member of the Académie Française in August 1753, and spent the main part of his subsequent researches in extending his <i>Histoire Naturelle</i>. There followed <i>l'Histoire naturelle des oiseaux</i> (in collaboration with Guéneau de Montbeillard and the abbé Bexon), then the <i>Supplément à l'Histoire naturelle</i>, 7 volumes, 1774-1789, including the <i>Epoques de la Nature</i> and <i>l'Histoire naturelle des minéraux</i> in collaboration with Faujas de Saint-Fond, 5 volumes, 1783-1788. The Count of Lacépède continued Buffon's enterprise after the latter's death.</p>
<p>A number of Buffon's articles provide an account of his probabilistic and statistical analyses , as well as his philosophy of mathematics. The discourse in “De la manière d'étudier et de traiter l'histoire naturelle", with which Buffon began his <i>Histoire naturelle</i>, gave him the opportunity of presenting his method and putting forward a theory of knowledge influenced by English thought, particularly that of Newton and Locke. He affirmed the role of the senses and the supremacy of experience in systematizing and presenting the laws of nature. Buffon drew a distinction between mathematical truths “which are only truths of definition" and thus arbitrary, and physical truths “which, instead of being based on assumptions we have made, are based only on facts". The certainty of a physical truth is to be measured by the probability of the corresponding facts. Buffon was to refine this epistemological thought in his “Essai d'arithmétique morale" of 1777 (within <i>Supplément à l'Histoire naturelle</i>, vol. IV), which is concerned with “the measurement of uncertain things". But, more broadly, the work is devoted to reflections on the concept of measurement, and the way in which it can provide information on reality. In it Buffon develops his thoughts on probability, which are dominated by the distinction between physical and moral viewpoints, that is between what is applicable to natural phenomena, and what counts in human affairs. It was in the light of this distinction that Buffon had interpreted the results of his probability table for life expectancy in the paper “De la vieillesse et de la mort", showing that the first 15 years of an individual should be “morally" considered as non-existent. It was equally in the light of this distinction that the “Essai d'arithmétique morale" attempted to obtain a numerical and probabilistic estimate of degrees of certainty, of which the minimal limit was the moral certainty. Beyond this lay the field of probabilities which were negligible in practice. Applying these considerations to the study of the St Petersburg problem, Buffon appealed for the first time to statistical experiment to <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">test</a> calculations against reality, and suggested an estimate of the “moral value" of money, which led to a solution of the problem similar to that given by <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=22" name="menu0">Daniel Bernoulli</a> (q.v.). Buffon had already fallen back on statistical methods in his paper “De la vieillesse et de la mort" in Volume II of the <i>Histoire naturelle</i>, in which he had studied human mortality in general, and praised the excellence of the work of A. Deparcieux (1703-1768). It was on the latter's <i>Essai sur les probabilités de la durée de la vie humaine</i> of 1746 that he had prepared a report of 1745 for the Academy, in collaboration with Nicolle, while expressing regret that the population included only persons of private means. That was the reason why Buffon used Dupré de Saint-Maur's mortality tables, which included 3 Paris parishes, and 12 country parishes in which there had been 23,994 deaths. The statistical parameter chosen to define the probability of life expectancy was the median. These tables, published by Buffon, were taken up by Moheau in his <i>Recherches et considérations sur la population de la France</i> in 1778. In 1777, in his article “Des probabilités de la durée de la vie" in Volume IV of the <i>Supplément à l'Histoire naturelle</i>, Buffon refined this statistical work, correcting the raw data, particularly the anomalies observed in the ages corresponding to whole numbers. Using a moving average method, he took advantage of the comments in the work of Deparcieux, and thus obtained his probabilities of life expectancy, whose knowledge he wrote “is one of the most interesting topics in the natural history of man". Buffon added to his “Probabilities de la durée de la vie", a paper on the “Etat général des naissances, mariages et morts dans la ville de Paris" for the period 1709-1766, as well as for the main towns of Burgundy for 1770-1774. From these, he tried to establish the fertility rate of marriages, the ratio of births and deaths by sex, the rates of births and deaths, and the evolution of marriages and deaths year by year. Using the whole of these data, he endeavoured to compare mortality in Paris and in the country, then made a comparison of mortality in France and London, in which he took a position in the controversy about the respective healths of the cities of London and Paris.</p>
<p>These statistical and demographic works of Buffon have attracted widely diverging judgments from different authors; in particular the reader might consult M. Fréchet (in Piveteau, 1954, pp. 435-436), L. Badey (1929), K. Pearson (1978, pp. 188-197), and J. and M. Dupâquier (1985, pp. 174-175 and 232).</p>
<p>Buffon's writings influenced Thomas Jefferson's <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i> (1782), and the two met in Paris during Jefferson's sojourn (1784-1789) as U.S. Minister to France.<br />

</script>%%\hfill {Summary inserted by E.S. 22.3.2000} \noindent{\bf Aleksander Aleksandrovich CHUPROV (or TSCHUPROW)}\\ b. 5 February 1874 (o.s.) - d. 19 April 1926 \vspace{.5cm} \noindent{\bf Summary} The correspondence between Chuprov and Markov marks the coming together of statistics and probability into mathematical statistics in the Russian Empire. As an \'emigr\'e after the Revolution in Russia, Chuprov worked on statistical dependence, and discovered optimal allocation of a sample between strata. \vspace{.5cm} Chuprov was born in Mosal'sk, Russia, and died an \'{e}migr\'{e} in Geneva, having fallen ill in autumn of 1925 during the Rome session of the International Statistical Institute, to which he had been elected in 1911. His father (A.I.) Aleksander Ivanovich Chuprov (1842-1908), with whom our Chuprov (A.A.) is often confused, particularly when the patronymic middle initial is omitted in their writings, was for many years a professor of political economy and statistics at Moscow University. A.I. was the ideological driving force behind {\it zemstvo} (an institution of local government) statistics, wherefrom the practice of sample surveys in the Russian Empire originated. He heavily influenced his son's formative years. A.A. initially (1892-1896) studied in the Physico-Mathematical Faculty of Moscow University which he completed with a dissertation on probability theory as a basis for theoretical statistics under the partial supervision of P.A. Nekrasov (1853-1924), who was a direct cause of A.A.'s later association with Markov (q.v.). Chuprov then travelled to Germany to study political economy. The years 1897-1901 were spent at Strasbourg University where his teachers were L. Bortkiewicz (q.v.) with whom he established a lasting friendship, and G.F. Knapp who supervised his doctoral dissertation {\it Die Feldgemeinschaft, eine morphologische Untersuchung} published in 1902. After his return to Russia in 1901, specifically to Moscow, A.A. was offered a position in 1902 in the newly formed Economics Section of the St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute, where he was in charge of the organization and teaching of statistics till mid-1917. In 1909 his {\it Ocherki po Teorii Statistiki (Topics in the Theory of Statistics)} for which he was awarded a doctorate by Moscow University, was published and ran into a second edition within a year. It had great influence for a time in Russia because of its stress on the logical and mathematical approach to statistics, and because it contains an account of the then fast-developing stability theory of statistical series of trials (dispersion theory) of W. Lexis (q.v.) and Bortkiewicz. A postcard in response to its appearance from Markov brought Chuprov into awareness of Markov's work. The subsequent prolonged correspondence between them resulted into a focussing of Chuprov's researches into a theoretical direction, and indeed marks the coming together in the Russian Empire of probability and statistics into mathematical statistics. During the St. Petersburg period he produced a number of notable disciples, including O.N. Anderson (1887-1960) later to become eminent in Bulgaria and Germany, N.S. Chetverikov (or Tschetwerikoff) (1885-1973), B.I. Karpenko (1892-1976); and S.S. Kon (or Kohn) (1888-1933). Chuprov left Russia in June, 1917 (at the time of the Provisonal Government of Kerensky), to use, during the summer break, the materials of the Statistical Bureau in Stockholm to pursue his demographic studies on fertility and mortality as affected by the Great War; and on sample surveys. He had written on both topics during his St. Petersburg period. Proposed as Corresponding Member to the then Russian Academy of Science in his absence by P.B. Struv\`{e} (1870-1944), on 29 November, 1917, he was confirmed on the 2nd of December. Chuprov had meant to return to Petrograd (as St. Petersburg had been renamed) in September, 1917, but fell ill. In April 1918 the Soviet authorities invited him to take up the headship of the Central Statistical Office, but in fact he was never to return, possibly through lack of funds, possibly through unwillingness to face the post-revolutionary turbulence. In the years 1917-1919 he published in Stockholm a bulletin on world economy sponsored by Russian \'{e}migr\'{e} cooperative centres. This kind of publicistic work was the continuation of Chuprov's activity in St. Petersburg where he worked with V.A. Rosenberg and wrote on the need for agricultural reform and demographic questions, for the newspaper {\it Russkie Vedomosti (Russian News)} upto the time the newspaper was closed down by the Soviets. Its last number bears the note: \, publisher: A. Chuprov. In his obituary for Chuprov for the \'{e}migr\'{e} {\it Russkii Ekonomicheskii Sbornik (Revue Economique Russe)} Rosenberg stresses repeatedly that Chuprov remained apolitical. More entensive information, however, is available in Sheynin (1996). There is a pamphlet published in Stockholm, 1919, entitled {\it La D\'{e}composition du Bolchevisme} which is signed A. Tchouprov, Professeur d'\'{E}conomie politique \`{a} l'Universit\'{e} de Moscou, on the mismanagement by the Bolsheviks of power and economy, with a stinging attack on Lenin. The fact that the ``A. Tchouprov" who was ``professor of political economy at Moscow University" was A.I., deceased in 1908, suggests that the pamphlet (not written in A.A.'s usual German) may be a provocation. The stay in Stockholm also served to establish some prominence for Chuprov in the Scandinavian and English Statistical Schools, with publications in {\it Skandinavisk Aktuarietidskrift} and {\it Biometrika}. He moved to Dresden in 1920, and after some years spent in solitary and intense productivity without steady income, he was invited in 1924 to the University of Christiania (now Oslo), and in the same year elected Honorary Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society. From his course of lectures in Christiania where his main contact appears to have been Alf Guldberg, arose Chuprov's (at the time) celebrated book published in 1925 as {\it Grundbegriffe und Grundprobleme der Korrelationstheorie}, in 1926 in a Russian version (with a new Foreword, dated Rome, 21 November, 1925); and in English translation in 1939. His influence in Scandinavia was now substantial, with several publications in {\it Nordisk Statistisk Tidskrift}, founded in 1922. He spent the Spring and Summer of 1925 in Prague, where he was appointed professor in the Russian Juridicial Faculty and associate of the Economic Cabinet of Prof. S.N. Prokopovich, editor of {\it Russkii Ekonomicheskii Sbornik} which appeared in Prague over the years 1925-1928, and was perhaps the most important academic Russian \'{e}migr\'{e} journal of the post-revolution period. S.S. Kon, V.A. Rosenberg and P.B. Struv\`{e}, all now \'{e}migr\'{e}s in the Russian colony in Prague, provided the necessary connections. The \'{e}migr\'{e} period was intensely productive for Chuprov. The earlier work on dispersion theory led to an extensive investigation of sample moments in terms of population moments (estimation by the method of moments), under, ultimately, very general conditions involving correlated observations, published in {\it Metron} in 1923. This contained an obvious application of such results to sample survey theory, anticipating several results of J. Neyman (q.v.), especially the well-known fomula for optimal allocation, which Chuprov obtained in the most elegant way: an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz-Buniakovsky inequality. (Neyman recognized Chuprov's priority in 1952). Work of such general nature led to Chuprov's propagation of the modern stochastic view of statistical theory: the sampling distribution for sample statistics, with inference based on conceptual repetitions of samples, and the Weak Law of Large Numbers. His lasting contribution to mathematical statistics rests on an early recognition of these fundamental ideas and their lucid and extensive popularization on the Continent. He is often credited with unifying several streams of statistical thinking: the Russian probabilistic; the German (typified by Lexis and Bortkiewicz and developing into the ``Continental direction" of statistics); and that of the English Biometric School of Galton and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.). Almost unknown, because of publication in 1922-23 in a Russian-language Berlin-based \'{e}migr\'{e} journal is some remarkable work on finite exchangeability by Chuprov and his student Ya. Mordukh (Seneta, 1987). The latter was helped to settle in London by Dr. Leon Isserlis, who was one of Chuprov's supporters in England. Others included J.M. Keynes, F.Y. Edgeworth (q.v.) and A.L. Bowley. In his 1921 {\it A Treatise on Probability}, Keynes speaks of 3 great Russian names in the general theory of statistics: Chebyshev (q.v.), Markov and Chuprov. The Russian community in Prague reacted with great grief to the news of Chuprov's death. The {\it Russkii Ekonomicheskii Sbornik} printed the news in No.5 (1926), with a photograph on p. 5 followed by a black-bordered anonymous obituary on pp. 6-8, and Chuprov's brief autobiography followed by some supplementary biographical information on pp. 9-10. There was a public meeting on the 27 April 1926 in memory of him, and pp. 5-33 of No.6 (1926) were given over to obituaries by Rosenberg and Kon. Page 3 printed a Resolution of Condolence from the Royal Statistical Society. There was a similar meeting on 6 May 1926 in the USSR, with orations by Chetverikov, Slutsky (q.v.) and N.M. Vinogradova. Obituaries were later published in {\it Metron} by Chetverikov, and {\it Nordisk Statistisk Tidskrift} by Kohn (Kon) in particular, with {\it Biometrika} publishing a portrait. A.A.'s standing in the statistical world is well-expressed by the above-mentioned Resolution of Condolence (dated 16 June, 1926): \begin{quote} ``The premature death of Professor Tschuprow has deprived the world of an investigator whose contributions to science were admired by all and which did much to harmonise the methods of statistical research developed by continental and British workers." \end{quote} \vspace {.5cm} \begin{thebibliography} Eliseeva, I.I.

<p><b>Marquis de CONDORCET</b><br />
b. 17 September 1743 - d. 29 March 1794<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Condorcet applied mathematics in precocious and philosophically argued fashion to humanistic and social problems. His probabilistic work is full of interesting ideas on mathematical expectation, inverse probability and taking into account evolution over time, amongst others.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet was born in Ribemont, Picardy, in the north of France. His father, a military man from a Dauphiné family, died when Condorcet was only a few weeks old. The boy was raised by his mother's family in Picardy in a bourgeois legal setting accustomed to economic and political reponsibilities. Following his studies with the Jesuits at Rheims, then at the Collège de Navarre in Paris, he devoted himself to pure mathematics, with the direct goal of obtaining general results in the integral calculus. His early work, begun towards the end of the the 1750's in collaboration with his friend and first teacher, the Abbé Girault de Keroudou, were both praised and criticized by Fontaine and D'Alembert (q.v.) who found fault with the often confused and excessively general style. Nevertheless, his research on the integral calculus resulted in his election to the Academy of Sciences at the age of 26. It culminated in the early 1780's in a treatise (regrettably unpublished) containing in particular a theorem on the integration of differential equations in terms of a finite number of explicit functions, 40 years before Liouville.</p>
<p>Starting in 1767-1770 Condorcet wrote several papers on law, political arithmetic and the calculus of probabilities; but these were dated and published only in 1994. After seriously considering d'Alembert's doubts on the foundations and relevance of the calculus of probabilities, and stimulated by Beccaria, the young mathematician discovered the likelihood principle before Laplace. This principle in its so called Bayesian interpretation allows us to go from effects to causes within a probabilistic framework. He did the same with what is now referred to as the rule of sucession of Bayes-Laplace, in which if an event occurs <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ m$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/17/l2h/img1.png" title="$ m$" width="21" /></span> times in <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/17/l2h/img2.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> trials, its probability may be estimated as <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (m + 1)/(m+n+2)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/17/l2h/img3.png" title="$ (m + 1)/(m+n+2)$" width="175" /></span> . Note that Bayes' (q.v.) works became known on the Continent only towards 1780. Condorcet's first researches, concerned with regular arrangements and the theory of mathematical expectation, were thus already noteworthy for his wish to make the calculus of probabilities useful in the political and moral sciences.</p>
<p>Following his active participation in Turgot's ministry (1774-1776), Condorcet, already an adjunct secretary of the Academy of Sciences, took up the position of permanent secretary until the most violent episodes of the French Revolution. He continued his research both in pure mathematics and in the calculus of probabilities. It was mostly after 1783 that he developed in detail and published his mature work on probabilities, including their “inverse" problems, as they are now referred to in mathematical statistics and the philosophical and practical conditions of their use. His <i>Essai</i> of 1785 contained a theory on the motive for belief, and the famous paradox of votes, but mainly an attempt to prove by an example (that on judgments) “that the truths of the moral and polical sciences are subject to the same certainty as those which form the system of physical knowledge". This is true, he believed, so long as one introduced a quantitative basis for the different types of possible errors. In particular, the simultaneous evaluation of the probabilities of acquitting a guilty person and condemning an innocent one was at the basis of later works of Laplace. J. Neyman (q.v.) found inspiration for his theory of statistical <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a> with errors of the first and second kinds in the latter.</p>
<p>At the same time, Condorcet published six papers on the calculus of probabilities and articles in the <i>Encyclopédie méthodique</i>. These contained remarkable innovations: a theory of mathematical expectation with a solution of the St. Petersburg problem for a finite horizon, a theory of complexity of random sequences in regard to regular arrangements, a model for probabilistic dependence, which is none other than what are now called “Markov chains" and even “semi-Markov processes", and solutions to the problem of statistical estimation in the case of time-dependent probabilities of events. One might say that this foreshadows, perhaps clumsily and not very practicably, the concept of time series. He also produced a definition of probabilities starting from classes of events, and a theory of individual economic choice in a setting of universal risk and competition. Unfortunately, he was too daring in his writing, which suggested research programmes rather than concrete theorems; and the exposition of his ideas was so unclear and impractical that his original contributions were not understood in his lifetime or even in the two following centuries.</p>
<p>Strongly involved in the encyclopedic movement and a friend of D'Alembert, Turgot and Voltaire, Condorcet was the last of the “encyclopédistes" and the only one who lived through the French Revolution. He committed himself deeply to it, developing and illustrating his scientific vision of politics, while having little inclination to a romantic view of populist participation. This enabled him to work out some very fertile ideas on education, women, slavery,and the rights of man, but he often had little influence on current events. However exchange of ideas of political kind influenced developments in the U.S. through Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.</p>
<p>During the Terror, Condorcet went into hiding, writing his famous <i>Esquisse d'un Tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain</i>. He was arrested on 27 March 1794, and was found dead in the prison of Bourg-Egalité (Bourg-la-Reine) two days later. It is not known whether he committed suicide or died of apoplexy.</p>
<p>Much esteemed during his lifetime, Condorcet was considered a mediocre mathematician during the next one and a half centuries. It is only gradually, since 1950, thanks to G. Th. Guilbaud and D. Black that his scientific work has been reappraised, first in connection with the summing of preferences related to Arrow's theorem, and later perceived as that of a “mathematician-philosopher" who critically studied the conditions necessary to found the human and social sciences. His mathematical works, were in fact only rediscovered in the 1980's.<br />

<p><b>Antoine Augustin COURNOT</b><br />
b. 28 August 1801 - d. 30 March 1877<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Unacknowledged in his own times as founder of mathematical economics, Cournot was both mathematician and philosopher. He publicised the ideas of Bienaymé on the “variability of chances", and subjected the probability calculus to a perspicacious philosophical critique.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Cournot was born at Gray, in the Franche-Comté (France); his father was a merchant descended from a long line of farmers. Antoine successfully completed his secondary studies at the Jesuit College of Gray between 1809 and 1816 with ease, thanks (as he said) to his wide reading. Among the books which he read were the <i>Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes</i> of Fontenelle, and his <i>Éloges des Académiciens</i>, Laplace's (q.v.) <i>Exposition du système du monde</i>, the <i>Logique</i> (partly inspired by Pascal, (q.v.) of Port-Royal, the centre of the Jansenist movement in France; and the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence). In his <i>Souvenirs</i> Cournot (1913, p. 35) noted that these were the books “which had a decisive influence on all [his] subsequent ideas and studies". After four rather idle years during which he studied law out of interest, he was admitted to the Royal College of Besançon, in the special mathematics class, and later entered the École Normale in 1821 for a year, until the government closed it down on 6 September 1822. He then worked towards a licenciate degree in Science at the Sorbonne, attending the lectures of Lacroix and Hachette, and becoming friendly with Dirichlet. Thanks to Hachette, he had the opportunity of meeting Ampère and Laplace. He attended the Academy of Sciences, where he heard Poisson (q.v.), Biot, Arago, Gay-Lussac, Poinsot, Legendre (q.v.), Fourier and Cauchy deliver their papers. He was awarded his licentiate degrees in Science in 1823, and Law in 1827.</p>
<p>Unemployed after the closure of the École Normale, he became the tutor to Marshal Gouvion-Saint-Cyr's son, and contributed to the writing of the Marshal's memoirs, published in 1831. A contributor to Férussac's <i>Bulletin des sciences mathématiques</i>, he published numerous short notes in it from 1821 to 1831, as well as several articles from 1826 to 1831. In February 1829, he defended his doctoral thesis <i>Mémoire sur le mouvement d'un corps rigide soutenu par un plan fixe</i>, as well as a complementary thesis <i>De la figure des corps célestes</i>.</p>
<p>In 1834, Cournot translated and edited Sir John Herschel's <i>Treatise on Astronomy</i> to which he made an <i>Addition</i> (Addendum), namely “Sur la distribution des orbites cométaires" which was his first important contribution to the calculus of probabilities and statistics. He also translated Kater and Lardner's <i>Elements of Mechanics</i>, appending a chapter on the measurement of forces in the work of machines. On Poisson's (q.v.) recommendation, he was appointed Professor of Analysis and Mechanics in the Faculty of Sciences at Lyons. He served there for only one year, then being appointed Rector of the Grenoble Academy, with a Chair in the Faculty of Sciences, which he occupied until 1838.</p>
<p>It was in 1838 that he published his <i>Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses</i>(<i>Œuvres Complètes</i>, Volume VIII). In this work, he applied the theory of undetermined functions to economics. He thus made a fundamental contribution to mathematical economics, and introduced a concept of equilibrium, later rediscovered by the mathematician J.F. Nash, who was unaware of Cournot's earlier work, in the context of game theory. Nash was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics. Although this work of Cournot marks a fundamental advance in the history of political economy and mathematical game theory, it had no success during Cournot's lifetime, in contrast to his work on Herschel's <i>Treatise on Astonomy</i> (<i>Souvenirs</i>, p. 156). Cournot's work in economics was continued in his <i>Principes de la théorie des richesses</i> (<i>Œuvres Complètes</i>, Volume IX), published in 1863, and his <i>Revue sommaire des doctrines économiques</i> (<i>Œuvres Complètes</i>, Volume X), of 1877.</p>
<p>Also in 1838, Cournot published his second study in probability and statistics, entitled “Mémoire sur les applications du calcul des chances à la statistique judiciare" in Liouville's <i>Journal de Mathématiques pures et appliquées</i>.</p>
<p>Appointed Inspector of Education, 1836 to 1838, he was named Inspector General in 1838, a post which he held until 1854, when he became Rector of the Dijon Academy until his retirement in 1862. Meanwhile, he presided over the jury for the Agrégation (higher doctorate) in mathematics from 1839 to 1843, succeeding Poisson in this position. He retired to Paris, where he died some 15 years later.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the works in economics previously mentioned, as well as his pedagogical efforts, developed in his <i>Des Institutions d'instruction publique en France</i>, (<i>Œuvres Complètes</i>, Volume VII), of 1864, Cournot's opus appears to have evolved, in broad terms, in two distinct periods. Effectively, his <i>De l'origine et des limites de la correspondance entre l'algebre et la géométrie</i> (Œuvres Complètes, Volume VI-2), of 1847, which contains the first proof of the Criticality Theorem of his friend Bienaymé (q.v.) in the theory of branching processes, concludes the series of his strictly mathematical publications, and leads on to his great philosophical works published between 1851 and 1875. It is likely that it was not only the eye disease from which he suffered after 1843 which caused this reorientation, but also Cournot's conviction that he was more creative in philosophy than in mathematics. He writes in his <i>Souvenirs</i>, p. 154, regarding Poisson's evaluation of his early papers: “he found some philosophical depth in them, in which opinion I truly think that he was not wrong; furthermore, he predicted that I would make great advances in the field of pure mathematical speculation, which was (as I always thought and never hesitated to say) one of his errors". But the chronological sequence of his two periods masks the profound unity of Cournot's thinking; Cournot the mathematician never lost sight of the philosophical implications of his research, while Cournot the philosopher found in mathematics the special expression of the power of pure reason. The guiding principle of his epistemology is that science and philosophy must necessarily intermingle, but without becoming confused, a principle which Euler had already enunciated.</p>
<p>The probabilistic and statistical work of Cournot consists mainly of the two studies of 1834 and 1838, previously mentioned, and the <i>Exposition de la théorie des chances et des probabilités</i> of 1843 (<i>Œuvres Complètes</i>, Volume I), copiously annotated by Bernard Bru.</p>
<p>The <i>Addition</i> of 1834 gave him the chance to denounce the common prejudice, according to which it was necessary in any statistical analysis “ always to collect a large number of elements, although this need is often not established by either theory or experiment". It also allowed him to illustrate the fact that, just as both descriptive and theoretical astronomy serve as a model for other sciences, so also “the statistics of stars ... must one day serve as a model for all other disciplines". The publication of the “Mémoire sur les applications du calcul des chances à la statistique judiciaire" followed shortly after Poisson's <i>Recherches sur la probabilité des jugements</i> of 1837. In it he took up in a critical manner the analyses involved, which, like Poisson, he compared with the <i>Comptes généraux de l'administration de la justice criminelle</i>, published from 1825 on, without relying on the Bayesian methods of Condorcet (q.v.) and Laplace. His main objective was to introduce a conceptual clarification in this area, and show that since legislators and geometers (that is: mathematicians) must share the responsibility of taking an overview of legal organization from a general standpoint, rather than through particular cases, both need statistics to validate their analyses.</p>
<p>The contents of the two previous studies were integrated into Cournot's major probabilistic and statistical work, the <i>Exposition de la théorie des chances</i> of 1843. This attempted to present more than the rules and methods of the calculus of probabilities and of statistics. As B. Bru (<i>Exposition</i>, Introduction, p.IX), points out, it offers the first global exposition of the theory of “the variability of chances" of which the elements are to be found dispersed among the works of his “excellent friend" Bienaymé.<a href="#foot73" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a> But Cournot most especially proposed to submit the principles and methods of the calculus of probabilities and statistics to a critical analysis, aiming to establish precisely their significance and effective scope. Such an analysis demands making a distinction between mathematical and philosophical probabilities, and arriving at an understanding of the double meaning of mathematical probability, which is “sometimes connected to a certain measurement of our knowledge and sometimes to a measurement of the possibility of events independent of the knowledge we may have" (p. 4). In statistics too, Cournot insisted on taking into account the extent to which statistical analysis was subject to a “preliminary judgement" which depended on philosophical probabilities (p. 132), which is the crux of the continuing frequentist/Bayesian dichotomy in our time. As against the perception, still current in our day, of statistics as simply accumulation of data and its description, Cournot held that it constituted a genuine science, whose aim was to obtain “numerical results relatively independent of the anomalies of chance, and which indicate the existence of regular causes whose action is combined with that of random causes"(p. 123). Cournot argued that the question was “far less to accumulate numbers whose quantity lead to stable means, than to disentangle the chance-affected influences which are mixed together" (p. 138), the discipline of statistics thus offering a special instrument for bringing to light the mechanisms of reality.<br />

<p><b>Harald CRAMÉR</b><br />
b. 25 September 1893 - d. 5 October 1985<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Harald Cramér, mathematical master craftsman, contributed pathbreaking research in probability, statistics, and insurance mathematics, and to the illumination of statistics as a coherent mathematical discipline.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Harald Cramér was born in Stockholm, Sweden on September 25, 1893 and spent virtually his whole life there. He entered the University of Stockholm in 1912, studying Chemistry and Mathematics. He made several scientific contributions in Chemistry with H. v. Euler before turning single mindedly to mathematics, becoming a student of the influential Swedish mathematician Mittag Leffler and studying with the eminent Hungarian mathematician Marcel Riesz, then visiting Mittag-Leffler's Institute. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Dirichlet series, graduating in 1917, and published approximately 20 papers in analytic number theory over the next seven years. This research stood him in good stead later, since in it he became familiar with Fourier integrals of a type closely related to those which were central to his subsequent fundamental probabilistic contributions.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<b>Insurance Mathematician.</b></p>
<p>As reported in [4], a schism developed between Cramér and the powerful but evidently difficult Mittag-Leffler, who then strongly threatened Cramér's career prospects in pure mathematics in Scandinavia. As Cramér describes it, insurance companies provided a natural alternative employment avenue for young Swedish mathematicians and it was on such a career that he embarked in 1918 (also the year of his marriage). The change of mathematical focus turned out to be very fortunate in Cramér's view, since it introduced him to both insurance mathematics and associated probabilistic developments - leading to his later wide ranging probabilistic interests and contributions.</p>
<p>The insurance mathematics background of the time and Cramér's contributions to the field are well summarized in [4]. He quickly became one of the leading contributors to the basic theory of insurance risks both through his own work and through his influence on colleagues and students. These contributions of course mathematically describe fundamental mechanisms underlying insurance. But as noted in [4], he made even more immediately practical contributions to insurance such as a treatment of loadings in mortality assumptions. He provided a precise discussion of the bias necessary in premium estimation and developed the `zero point method' which was used for many years in setting insurance rates.</p>
<p>Most of Cramér's works in insurance mathematics were published in the 1920-1935 period. However his interest in the field was lifelong and he continued his contributions (both technical and educational) well beyond that time even while doing pioneering work in other areas. In particular his classic volume <i>Collective Risk Theory</i> was published in 1955 and revised in 1968.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<b>Probabilist.</b></p>
<p>During the 1920's Cramér was led naturally to an interest in probability through his work in insurance risk. He refers to this period as a “decade of preparation” for the explosive development of probability theory which was to follow, but it nevertheless contained important contributions of his own, as well as the blossoming developments by e.g.. Kolmogorov, Wiener, Lévy. Cramér had already begun using characteristic functions in an extensive study of central limit theory, and motivated by insurance applications he investigated the magnitude of the error in replacing a random sum by its normal limit. He gave an early version of the bound later given final form by his student Esseen in his 1944 thesis, the famous “Berry-Esseen Bound”, and detailed Edgeworth (q.v.) expansions for the error.</p>
<p>In 1929 Cramér was appointed to a new chair in “Actuarial Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics” at Stockholm University, set up at the instigation of the Swedish insurance companies. The institute became very active under his leadership and many of the now celebrated results of Cramér himself, and his students and colleagues emanated from it in the ensuing 20 years. The decade of the 30's (described by Cramér as the “Heroic Period”) saw dramatic developments in central limit and related theory, involving the Stockholm group (including Feller at that time) as well as that of Khintchine, Wiener, Lévy and others.</p>
<p>Cramér became deeply involved in the developing early theory of stationary processes. In particular he generalized the (1934) covariance representations of Khintchine to a vector context, and the 1938 thesis of his then student H. Wold contained the renowned decomposition of a stationary sequence into its deterministic and purely non-deterministic components.</p>
<p>The years of the second world war caused professional isolation but Cramér maintained a remarkable level of activity at the Stockholm Institute. For example the (1940) thesis by O. Lundberg (q.v.) on stochastic models provided an actuarial basis for non-life insurance which was widely used. He made the most of the few available opportunities for international contacts. One of these was a primarily Scandinavian conference he organized in Stockholm in 1941 at which he presented the spectral representation of a stationary process (surely one of his most remarkable and exciting results - also obtained independently by M. Loève in the war years).</p>
<p>In the postwar 1940's Cramér's Institute continued its strong stochastic process activity. This included fundamental work of Karhunen on stationary processes, the pathbreaking thesis of Cramér's then student Grenander involving inference for stochastic processes and the work of Cramér himself on general spectral representations for classes of nonstationary processes.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<b>Statistician.</b></p>
<p>“Probability” is surely the life blood of “statistics” and any dividing line is impossible to position. This is especially true of Cramér's work, much of which may be regarded as “Mathematical Methods of Statistics”, as indicated by the title to his most celebrated volume. This enormously influential work was written as a way of making good use of the period of enforced isolation caused by the second world war was described by Cramér as his “Calling card to the postwar scientific world” ([4]). It provided a wonderfully timely and lucid account of a hitherto hodge podge of often mysterious statistical procedures, now organized as a coherent mathematical discipline. It does of course contain many of its author's own contributions, including publication of the celebrated `Cramér-Rao' bound discovered independently by Rao (1945) <i>Mathematical Methods</i> has remarkably few blemishes (one being the constructive definition of Borel sets) and may be perhaps aptly described as “almost uniformly error free”. It has had immense influence on generations of statisticians and especially, I would conjecture, in encouraging young (myself included at the time!) mathematicians to enter and find a mathematically satisfying career in statistics and its applications.</p>
<p>One could not describe <i>Mathematical Methods</i> as a manual of applied statistics. But it clearly highlights the fact that Cramér was substantially motivated in his mathematical work by the potential for applications. Indeed, as noted in [1], he actually attempted to set up an applied statistics section in the Stockholm group, a plan which did not reach full fruition though a less formal applied activity was instituted.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<b>Administrative, and later years.</b></p>
<p>In 1950 Cramér was elected President of Stockholm University and in 1958 Chancellor of the entire Swedish university system. This administrative service undoubtedly had a severe impact on his scientific production but by no means halted it, as can be seen from his publications of the period. On his retirement from the Chancellorship in 1961 he again became very active in research. He made several extended visits to the U.S. to participate in research activities at the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) at the invitation of Gertrude Cox (q.v.), and to give lectures.</p>
<p>I first met Harald Cramér at RTI as we worked together there on a project involving the reliability of spacecraft guidance systems, under a contract with NASA. This sparked his interest in level-crossing and extremal problems for stationary processes in which he made important contributions - on which we wrote a joint book [3]. This again underscored his love for development of mathematics relevant to applications.</p>
<p>Simultaneously Cramér investigated questions of “multiplicity theory” and innovation representations” for vector stochastic processes. He wrote a series of approximately 10 basic papers in this area from 1960, the last being published in 1982, at age 89!</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<b>Some personal comments.</b></p>
<p>I have focussed in this biography on Cramér the scientist, and his pioneering research contributions, but there is much to be learned from other sides to his life and work, dealt with e.g. in [1, 4, 5]. Harald Cramér had few peers as teacher and educator, through his written works and incomparably clear classroom teaching, formal lectures and personal interactions. The direct application of his research work is perhaps clearest in the insurance context. But, as indicated throughout, his fundamental theoretical work substantially arose from the need to provide methods for dealing with real applied problems. Thus he strongly facilitated the use of probability and statistics and their wide ranging impact on society. His enormous personal educational impact is surely now less direct but nevertheless has permanently influenced the field.</p>
<p>Cramér's gentlemanly demeanor, courtesy and concern for others were a counter-example to the thesis that professional greatness must be accompanied by some form of social or character weakness. Finally, no record of the life of Harald Cramér should omit mention of his wife Marta - his lifelong companion from their 1918 marriage until her death in 1973. No doubt Cramér would have made pioneering contributions if he had remained single or had a less successful marriage. But the extraordinarily fine mutual support and life partnership with his “Beloved Marta”, and their strong family relationships gave an extra quality to his - indeed their - professional and human legacy.</p>
<p>Harald Cramér died in his native Stockholm on October 5, 1985, with the conviction he expressed just prior to his death, that his life's work was now complete.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<b>Further reading</b></p>
<p>Several detailed accounts are available of the life and work of Harald Cramér and his fundamental contributions in [1, 4, 6, 5, 7]. Especially illuminating is Cramér's own description in [2] which gives a fascinating account of this exciting period in probability and statistical science and his role in it. A reader interested in the details of Cramér's contributions and their motivating environment will be rewarded by study of [2] and the other references cited. In particular, [1] contains a comprehensive bibliography of his published works.<br />

<p><b>D'ALEMBERT</b><br />
b. 17 November 1717 - d. 29 October 1783<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. D'Alembert's doubts concerning the calculus of probabilities are more pertinent than has long been believed, and were the starting point for the work of Condorcet and Laplace.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>D'Alembert was the illegitimate son of the officer Destouches-Canon, and Madame de Tencin. He was abandoned on the steps of the church of Saint-Jean-le-Rond in Paris, and put in the care of a glazier's wife. Initially called Jean Le Rond, he later gave himself the name of J.B. Daremberg and then Dalembert or D'Alembert. In fact his father did not totally abandon him, since he provided for his education. The young man was a pupil at the Collège des Quatre-Nations, where he studied law and medicine, but he rapidly began to concentrate on mathematics. He became a member of the French Royal Academy of Sciences in 1741, as “adjunct astronomer" and soon became known through his <i>Traité de dynamique</i> (1743) which based mechanics on a new principle. In the few years until the beginning of the 1750's he published some papers of remarkable originality on fluids, vibrating strings, the precession of equinoxes, and lunar theory. We owe to the young D'Alembert the first equations with partial derivatives, the fundamental theorem of algebra, an essential contribution to the equations for perfect fluids, and the statement of a paradox in hydrodynamics. The style of the young author exhibited a number of characteristics which remained with him for life: the desire to construct theories starting only from a minimum of principles, a demanding nature which admitted nothing without an investigation of principles, a critical study of the link between mathematics and the conditions for its application, and a method of mathematical exposition which was often difficult to follow.</p>
<p>D'Alembert was also given to polemics, inflexible in his priorities and relentless against his adversaries; among these were <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=22" name="menu0">Daniel Bernoulli</a> (q.v.), Clairaut and Euler, who gave as good as they got.</p>
<p>In 1751 the first volume of the <i>l'Encyclopédie</i> appeared, with the preface “Discours préliminaire" written by D'Alembert. He had been made responsible for the mathematical section of this enterprise, and it was in this capacity that he wrote his first contributions to the calculus of probabilities. Following some indirectly critical articles on this topic a scandal broke out about the article on heads or tails, (croix ou pile) in volume IV of the <i>Encyclopédie</i>. D'Alembert contested principles accepted by everyone: he cast doubt, for example, on the fact that the probability of obtaining heads in two trials was 3/4, and suggested that it might be 2/3, arguing that there were in fact only three possible events (the coin is not thrown again if heads occurs at the first trial), namely heads, tails followed by heads, and tails followed by tails, the first two being favourable, while the third was not. D'Alembert was thus provocatively initiating a prickly debate on the question of equally likely events; this debate became even more prickly when the calculus of probabilities was applied to events in real life rather than simple games of chance. In his contribution to the famous St. Petersburg problem, he disputed not only Daniel Bernoulli's solution, in which the fate of a player is evaluated by a criterion other than the mathematical expectation, but also other solutions involving limiting the number of trials in the game, or neglecting smaller probabilities, etc. In other words, D'Alembert doubted not so much the abstract rules of probability, but rather the relevance of these rules to moral, that is human and social, behaviour. He would not tolerate the separation of the calculus of probabilities from its use in concrete examples. He refused to assume without severe appraisal all the simplifying hypotheses which one usually makes without much thought: the assumption that events are equally likely, their independence, the additivity of probabilities, and the linearity of expectation. He also found it difficult to bear not being able to take the effect of time into account in his calculations. In the calculus of probabilities, as also in mechanics and in the rest of science, he contested the principle of proportionality of causes to effects.</p>
<p>D'Alembert developed his doubts and objections in various works until his death, for example in his <i>Opuscules mathématiques</i>, and in books accessible to a larger public like his <i>Mélanges de philosophie</i>. An ideal case for the concrete discussion of the principles of the calculus of probabilities was provided by the controversy on inoculation which raged in the 1750's and 1760's. A supporter of inoculation, he did not accept the fact that one should measure its advantage simply by evaluating the increase in life expectancy. He was not happy with crude summary measures; he queried those indicators which we call the mean and the median, indirectly requiring a study of the variability. He wanted made explicit the manner of dealing, within the same calculation, with events separated by time; and insisted that one should distinguish the viewpoint of the individual from that of the State. In all these disputes Daniel Bernoulli was D'Alembert's main adversary. Bernoulli was a very skilled analyst, inclined to choose effective simplifications; he constructed striking and seductive theories, but refused to be dragged into discussions on the principles involved.</p>
<p>D'Alembert is not known for any theorems in the calculus of probabilities, nor what in the twentieth century is referred to as mathematical statistics. The essence of his contributions consists of criticisms, but it would be wrong to believe that he played a purely destructive role. On the one hand, his articles and papers contain propositions, such as, for example, a mathematical theory of inoculation (11th paper in the <i>Opuscules</i>), and a comparative criterion for distribution functions (23rd paper). On the other hand, D'Alembert's doubts stimulated the researches of young French mathematicians in the second half of the 18th century, in particular Condorcet (q.v) and Laplace (q.v.). This is clear from their writings: each in his own way, took some difficult questions posed by D'Alembert as a starting point to construct their own theories. Laplace's famous “Mémoire sur les probabilités des causes par les événements", published in 1774, which may in some sense be thought of as the starting point of modern mathematical statistics, is the most obvious example.</p>
<p>D'Alembert's ideas were partially eclipsed in the general area of mathematics by Euler and Lagrange,“ geometers" who were perhaps more able, but also gifted with a far more readable style, which appeared less archaic to the mathematicians of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the area of the calculus of probabilities, D'Alembert was considered very eccentric. Lacroix, who was among his more polite critics wrote in his treatise on probabilities (1816) “it can happen to the most eminent that they lose their way even in a very simple subject". However, this long-unquestioned judgement has been revised in the decade 1970-80; one may note today that D'Alembert had pinpointed some of the very real difficulties in the calculus of probabilities, particularly in its relation to reality. Looking back, one can see that he did not at the time have the methods to overcome a number of these problems.</p>
<p>D'Alembert took part in many other activities. A close acquaintance of Voltaire and Turgot, like Pascal (q.v.) before him an enemy of the Jesuits, he was one of the better known personalities in the <i>philosophes</i> movement. D'Alembert was first a member, and later permanent secretary (1772) of the Académie française, and a friend of Frederick II of Prussia. In this role he was a prime mover in the foundation of the Academy of Berlin and until his death in 1783, played a very important role in the organization of intellectual life in Europe.</p>
<p>His <i>Oeuvres Complètes</i> are currently in the course of publication. His name is known even to students of elementary mathematics through “D'Alembert's <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">test</a>" for convergence.<br />

<p><b>Georges DARMOIS</b><br />
b. 24 June 1888, d. 3 January 1960<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Darmois was the first French mathematician to teach and popularize British mathematical statistics. He was a pioneer in the theory of the statistical concept of sufficiency, in stellar statistics, and in factorial analysis.<br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Georges Darmois was born at Eply in the district of Meurthe-et-Moselle, France and died in Paris. He entered the École Normale Superiéure (ENS) in 1906, and defended a beautiful thesis in geometry which he had begun under the supervision of G. Darboux. From 1911 to 1914, he was a qualified assistant (agrégé préparateur) at the ENS, whose scientific activities were then directed by Émile Borel (q.v.) who rapidly grew to appreciate Darmois' energy and intelligence. Darmois' work was interrupted by the First World War, during which he served in the artillery, in particular with anti-aircraft batteries, and later in a section working on location by sound. This was Section 25, under the command of the physicist Gustave Ribaud (1884-1963), who had graduated with Darmois from the ENS, and with whom he collaborated on various technical studies. Ribaud was later to become a Professor in Strasbourg and Paris.</p>
<p>Darmois had a brilliant and practical mind, and was an enthusiastic and sound teacher. He discovered the calculus of probabilities by teaching its applications to military studies in the framework of the École des Généraux (School for Generals) in 1919. He was not the only scientific worker who had discovered probability and its applications during the 1914 war: other examples are Jules Haag with his treatise <i>Applications au tir (Applications to Gunnery)</i>, and Paul Lévy, although his case is not quite so clear.</p>
<p>On his discharge from the army, Darmois was appointed lecturer (chargé de cours) at the University of Nancy, where he was later Professor from 1921 to 1933. Once he had defended his thesis, he became interested in the new problems arising in the general theory of relativity. Fortet wrote in his obituary, “there is no doubt that this part of Georges Darmois' work was the most important thing he did, and it is first rate". Darmois' volume, published in 1927 in the <i>Mémorial des Sciences Mathématiques</i> initiated a large number of subsequent works, such as his pupil André Lichnérovicz's thesis of 1939.</p>
<p>It was also at Nancy that Darmois discovered English mathematical statistics through the work of Galton (q.v.), <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.), Yule (q.v.), Spearman and especially R.A. Fisher (q.v.), whose genius he was among the first to recognize. Darmois began to teach this statistics in France in 1923. Thus it was to him that Borel decided to hand over his course in probability and statistics at the Institute of Statistics of the University of Paris (ISUP), created in 1923, when Borel was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1925. Darmois rapidly understood the fundamental importance which statistics must shortly assume in all branches of science and economics, a cause for which Borel had fought from the very beginning of the century. Starting in 1923, Darmois appears to have had “the will to create a school of theoretical and applied statistics in France" (Fortet 1960). One could say that the ISUP, of which he was the Director of Studies from 1944 on, and the centres which gradually became attached to it, were basically his creation. Darmois' statistics course, very Anglocentric in its style and spirit, was published in 1928 and translated into Spanish, Chinese and even into English. One should also mention his small book of 1934 which contains interesting comments on the applications of statistics to economics and psychology. Thus Georges Darmois swam against the French probabilistic current between 1930 and 1950; the opinion of French probabilists on British researchers was lukewarm, and they sought “to take inspiration from physics rather than economics or sociology", as Fortet puts it in his note of 1960. Moreover, the French School of statistics had difficulty in grasping the direction in which history was moving after the Second World War, just at the time when theoretical and applied statistics suddenly acquired an added dimension, and came to the forefront almost everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>In mathematical statistics, Darmois' original contributions of the 1930's and 1940's are particularly interesting. Let us note particularly his work on the concept of sufficiency; Darmois appears to have been the first to study it in the general framework of exponential models. We should also point out that the general Cramér-Rao inequality is partly due to Darmois, as well as others before and after him (see the note by L.Lebart on this topic in Benzécri, 1982). Darmois was also one of the pioneers of stellar statistics; and of factorial analysis. As an outcome of this last interest, his name is commemorated in the Skitovich-Darmois Theorem for the characterization of the normal distribution by the independence of linear forms, although he did little more than enunciate a general form (Darmois, 1951). The case of two variables had been initiated by S. Bernstein (q.v.) in 1941, and is known as Bernstein's Theorem. However, Darmois soon lost his interest in contemporary research in mathematical statistics. Whether because of his nature or through choice, Darmois progressively devoted himself to teaching and the dissemination of statistical methods at all levels. This included the work of Neyman (q.v.), Wald (q.v.) and the various American Schools of the post-war years of which he knew, and had encouraged in their early years, but whose developments he had not kept up with, possibly because of his loyalty to Fisher, and certainly because he was busy with other projects. Nevertheless, we should note that among those researchers who learned their probabilistic statistics from Darmois were such remarkable personalities as Doeblin, Loève, Halphen, Malécot, Guilbaud, Massé, LeCam and others. Thus Edmond Malinvaud reminiscing about his master, who in 1953-54 had asked him to give an innovative course on econometric methods, found a beautiful form of words to speak of “Georges Darmois, who thought so well and taught so well, but wrote so little (though I should have said `but published so little')".</p>
<p>Darmois was appointed to the Faculté des Sciences de Paris in 1933 on the death of Painlevé. He was tenured in 1942 while he was in Britain “appointed irrespective of his will" (Archives Nationales AJ/16/5737). In fact, Darmois was part of the Anglo-French Scientific Mission which happened to be in Britain at the time of France's collapse in June 1940. He decided, or had it decided on his behalf, that he should not return to France. From 1940 to 1944, he was entrusted with teaching and research assignments for the Free French, first in London and later in Algiers, where no one held him by force. Exempted from Army service, he taught at the University of Algiers, where he supervised two theses in statistics. The administrative fiction of Darmois' being held in Britain against his will allowed him to retain his salary, and to pursue his career most honorably. In contrast, his brother Eugène (1884-1958), a physicist who was Professor in the Faculté des Sciences de Paris, was accused of being a collaborator after the liberation of France. Suspended from his duties for a time, like Julia and de Broglie, he was reinstated “with a reprimand" in December 1944, and was even elected to the Academy of Science in 1951.</p>
<p>It was Darmois who succeeded Fréchet (q.v.) in the Chair of the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics at the Sorbonne in 1949. He retired in 1958, shortly before his death in January 1960. His successor, Fortet, was the last holder of the historical chair of the Calculus of Probabilities, which was abolished together with all other chairs by the Loi d'orientation (Orientation Law) of 1968. Dugué was then appointed director of the ISUP, a responsibilility which he fulfilled for twenty years until his retirement.</p>
<p>Georges Darmois was elected to the Academy of Science in 1955 in the Astronomy Section, to take up Jean Chazy's (1882-1955) place. Among positions held by him, were the Presidencies of the Société Mathématique de France and the Société Statistique de Paris. He represented France in all the international statistical institutions, and from 1953 until the time of his death in 1960, served as the ninth President of the International Statistical Institute. One should add that Darmois for a long time managed a family smelting works, and always retained close contacts with French industrial circles.</p>
<p>On the basis of the opinions of all who knew him, Darmois was an extraordinarily dynamic man, who was open to the influences of both things and people. The number of his pupils and the diversity of subjects in which he guided them bear witness to this. He was gifted with a brilliant vitality, an illuminating intelligence and immense goodwill. Most of this he directed towards the young researchers who came to him from all parts of the world, many of whom continue to recall him with profound gratitude.<br />

<p><b>Daniel BERNOULLI</b><br />
b. 8 February 1700 - d. 17 March 1782<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Daniel Bernoulli, well known as a mathematician, provided the earliest mathematical model describing an infectious disease. In 1760 he modelled the spread of smallpox, which was prevalent at the time, and argued the advantages of variolation.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>One of the purposes of modelling the spread of an infectious disease mathematically is to provide a framework within which predictions can be made about its progress within a population susceptible to infection. Perhaps the first such model for an infectious disease was that for smallpox due to Daniel Bernoulli.</p>
<p>Daniel, who was born in Groningen in 1700, was a member of the famous Bernoulli mathematical family, the second son of Johann I (Jean) Bernoulli, brother of the older and more famous Jakob I (Jacques). He studied mathematics under his father and medicine at Heidelberg receiving his M.D. in 1721. In 1724 he published “Exercitationes Mathematicae", solving Riccati's equation, and in 1725, he was appointed to the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg, which had just been founded by Peter the Great. He remained there until 1732.</p>
<p>After Peter's death in 1725, there followed a period of unrest until the imperial succession was settled. Bernoulli returned to Basel in 1733, to accept a post in Anatomy and Botany; this was followed in 1743 by one in Physiology and in 1750 by another in Physics. His interests remained very diverse, and he pursued his research into mathematics (including probability), medicine, physics, botany, anatomy and philosophy, writing several treatises on these subjects. In 1734 he published his “Memoire sur l'Inclinaison des Orbites Planetaires", followed in 1738 by his “Traite d'Hydrodynamique", and a paper on the measurement of risk (1738). In 1740 his “Traite sur les Marees" appeared, and shortly after, his work on vibrating strings and rods. He was involved in quarrels with his friend Euler on the mathematical theory of the vibrating string, and with D'Alembert (q.v.) on his work on risk and the merits of variolation.</p>
<p>Basel was very close to Alsace and the French frontier, and while the Swiss cantons maintained their independence, intellectual and particularly scientific life was centered on France and its Royal French Academy of Sciences in Paris. Between 1725 and 1749, Bernoulli won 10 Prizes from this Academy, including the Prize of Honour for his clepsydra (water clock) to measure time at sea.</p>
<p>For most of Bernoulli's mature life, the intellectual climate was dominated by the “philosophes" who believed in rationalism and enlightenment; their views were presented in the <i>Encyclopedie</i> of Diderot (1713-1784), for which D'Alembert wrote the Introduction. Diderot himself was the author of an article on probability and inoculation commenting on D'Alembert's critiques of Bernoulli's papers on these topics. Although France suffered from its defeat in the Seven Years War (1756-1763), its population had grown rapidly in the later half of the 18th century, as famines and epidemics became rarer; it reached some 26 million by 1789. The size and health of the population was of vital concern in the recruitment of soldiers for the king's army.</p>
<p>Bernoulli was interested in the ravages caused by smallpox, which was prevalent at the time. He devised a simple deterministic model to relate the size of a cohort <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ w(t)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img1.png" title="$ w(t)$" width="40" /></span> of individuals at time <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img2.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> after birth, with the number of susceptibles <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x(t)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img3.png" title="$ x(t)$" width="37" /></span> among them who had not been infected with smallpox. To make his equations easier, he assumed that individuals infected by smallpox died immediately, or recovered immediately and became immunes <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ z(t)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img4.png" title="$ z(t)$" width="35" /></span> , so that <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ w(t) = x(t) + z(t)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img5.png" title="$ w(t) = x(t) + z(t)$" width="151" /></span> . By setting up and solving two ordinary differential equations he obtained the relation</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle x(t) = w(t)/[(1-a)e^{bt} + a] $" border="0" height="41" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img6.png" title="$\displaystyle x(t) = w(t)/[(1-a)e^{bt} + a] $" width="227" /></div>
where <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img7.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> is the rate of catching smallpox and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img8.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> the proportion of those infected with smallpox who die instantaneously. Setting <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ a = 1/8$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img9.png" title="$ a = 1/8$" width="68" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ b = 1/8$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img10.png" title="$ b = 1/8$" width="66" /></span> , and using Halley's (1693) life tables he was able to estimate the numbers of susceptibles in a cohort subject to smallpox at time <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ t &gt;0$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/22/l2h/img11.png" title="$ t &gt;0$" width="46" /></span> , as well as the increased expectation of life if smallpox were eliminated. He calculated that this expectation would increase from 26 years 7 months to 29 years 9 months. If smallpox could be eliminated, then by age 26, the population would be some 14% larger. He used his results to argue the advantages of variolation; in an earlier popular article (1760), he wrote “The two great motives for inoculation are humanity and the interest of the State". It should be mentioned that the Bernoulli family in Basel had several of its younger members variolated.
<p>Variolation, or the inoculation of susceptibles by live virus from patients with a mild form of the disease, was becoming popular in Europe at that time. The practice had originated in China as early as 1,000 AD; Chinese doctors had ground the scabs of dried smallpox pustules into powder, this being inhaled by individuals wishing to acquire immunity. The custom had migrated to India and Turkey in a modified form involving inoculation with live virus from smallpox pustules. In the early 18th century, travellers to Turkey had reported on the success of variolation, and some doctors in Europe began to practise it. Unfortunately, even virus from a patient with a mild form of smallpox did not guarantee a mild attack in the new host.</p>
<p>In a paper presented to the Royal French Academy of Sciences in Paris in 1760, Bernoulli set out to present the advantages of variolation. He became involved in a quarrel with D'Alembert on the interpretation of the relative risks of death from smallpox and variolation; D'Alembert maintained that the real risks of the latter were 17 times greater than those of smallpox itself. However, he eventually moderated his objections, and the paper was finally published in 1766. The potential benefits of variolation became irrelevant within 3 decades, as Jenner demonstrated the safety of the cowpox vaccine against smallpox in England in 1796.</p>
<p>Among his many mathematical works, Daniel Bernoulli also made important contributions to probability theory, for example to what became known as the St. Petersburg paradox, to which his cousin Nicholas Bernoulli (q.v.) also contributed usefully. Sheynin (1972) refers to 8 memoirs on probability published between 1738 and 1780, also briefly described in Todhunter (1865). Possibly the most interesting are the memoirs on the normal law, the measurement of risk (1738), the theory of errors, and various urn problems. In his “Traite d'Hydrodynamique", Bernoulli studied the effect of pressure and temperature on gases; assuming that a gas consisted of small particles, he treated the problem by the probabilistic methods of Pascal (q.v.) and Fermat (q.v.). This was the first attempt to develop a kinetic theory of gases, a feat later achieved by Maxwell and Boltzmann in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Bernoulli died in Basel in 1782, laden with honours, a polymath whose works on mathematics, probability and infectious disease modelling were recognized for their originality, depth and practical applicability.</p>

</script>\noindent{\bf W. Edwards DEMING}\\ b. 14 October 1900 - d. 20 December 1993 \vspace{.5 cm} \noindent{\bf Summary.} Long recognized as a leading proponent of statistical sampling and approaches to quality improvement, Deming led major efforts to bring statistical approaches and methods to bear on problems in government, science and industry. \vspace{.5cm} William Edwards Deming was born in Sioux City, Iowa, USA, and died at the age of 93 in Washington, D.C. Deming was active to the end of his life; he spoke at the Joint Statistical Meetings in San Francisco in the summer of 1993, and he had presented a four-day seminar on quality management as recently as December 7-10 in the Los Angeles area. At the time of his death, Deming was arguably the most famous living statistician. Deming studied at the Universities of Wyoming (B.S. 1921) and Colorado (M.S. in Mathematics and Physics, 1924) before going to Yale University, where he received his doctorate in Physics in 1928. From 1927 through 1939 he held an appointment as Mathematical Physicist in the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Deming was instrumental in arranging lecture series at the USDA. Fisher (q.v.) spoke in 1936, but the more influential series was one presented in April 1937 by <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=77" name="menu1">Jerzy Neyman</a> (q.v.). Deming arranged the publication of Neyman's lectures as a mimeographed book, Lectures and Conferences on Mathematical Statistics (USDA, 1938; 2nd ed. 1952), one of the earliest and most widely read American textbooks on mathematical statistics. Deming also lectured on least squares, and he assisted Shewhart (q.v.) in the 1939 publication of his lectures as well. Subsequently, from 1939 to 1945, he was Head Mathematician and Advisor in Sampling to the U.S. Bureau of Census, where among his innovations was the application of Shewhart's quality control ideas to the Census's coding and cardpunching operations, and the introduction (with F. Stephan) of the Deming-Stephan algorithm for the iterative proportional fitting of contingency tables. During 1942-45, at the instigation of W. Allen Wallis, Deming was actively involved with Holbrook Working in arranging a highly successful series of short courses on the use of statistics in support of the war effort. In 1945, Deming moved to a position as Advisor in Sampling in the Bureau of the Budget. Deming's great international fame arose from his work on the re-establishment of Japanese industry after the Second World War. From 1947-50, Deming had been assigned to General Douglas MacArthur's Supreme Command of the Allied Powers in Tokyo, as Advisor in Sampling Techniques, and he remained to consult with the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) for two years after that. It was a most agreeable arrangement for both sides. Deming had come upon Shewhart's methods of quality control in 1928 and had written and spoken about them on many occasions; in Japan he found an eager audience. Post-war Japan by 1950 had a reputation for such poor quality products that it eagerly embraced Deming and statistical control methods, both for the substance of the methods and the symbolism of Deming as an icon of American values. In 1950 JUSE established the Deming Prize for excellence in quality control, and the prize has been awarded annually since 1951. Deming's contributions to quality improvement in Japanese industry became the ``stuff'' of legends and in the later decades of his life the story was retold in many ways by many different authors (e.g., see Mann, 1987). Thereafter, although he held various adjunct teaching positions (including at New York University (NYU) and at Columbia University) he worked out of his Washington, D.C. home as a private consultant. He conducted frequent multi-day seminars in the U.S. and overseas on managerial methods. He insisted upon the involvement of top-level management in his programs, and he attacked the use of production quotas and performance criteria, emphasizing cooperative problem solving. His approaches to management were reduced to a 14-point philosophy (e.g., see Deming, 1986) and promulgated by many others in the United States and abroad. Deming's great gifts were enormous energy and an early keen sense of the broad applicability of statistical methods in government, science, and industry. The ideas he is associated with came from many sources: quality control from Shewhart, statistical methods from Fisher and Neyman, sampling techniques from Stephan and Hansen. But the mixture of these and the forceful way he melded them to a philosophy of management were his own. He also had a great interest in the history of statistics, and in 1940 he arranged for the reprinting of two original papers by Thomas Bayes (q.v.), adding his own commentary to Bayes's paper on divergent series. Deming married Agnes Bell in 1922, and she died eight years later. In 1932 he married Lola E. Shupe, who had been a co-author on a number of physics articles with Deming and later helped him with calculations for his research. She died in 1986. Deming was awarded the President's National Medal of Technology in 1987, but characteristically Deming was unwilling to cancel a previously arranged managerial seminar in Detroit; the medal was received from President Reagan on his behalf by his two daughters at a White House Rose Garden ceremony. Deming was the President of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1945. \vspace{.5cm} \noindent{\bf Deming on Least Squares and the Adjustment of Data} In 1934, Deming published, jointly with the UC Berkeley Physicist Raymond T. Birge, an influential paper ``On the Statistical Theory of Errors.'' This review paper brought the methods of Fisher, Neyman and Pearson (q.v.), and Jeffreys (q.v.) to a broad audience of American physical Scientists. It was reprinted with additional notes in 1937 by the Graduate School of the USDA, and it served effectively as a textbook for over a decade. In correspondence with Deming, Fisher was generally quite complimentary, although in a 1940 letter to <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=36" name="menu0">Maurice Frechet</a> (q.v.) about Deming and Birge, Fisher complained that he found ``these writers very often obscure.'' This material also made its way into Deming's mimeographed lecture notes on least squares which first appeared in 1938, which he later turned into the 1943 book on the adjustment of statistical data. Deming worked with Frederick Stephan on what was an crucial problem for the Bureau of the Census, how to adjust a sample table of counts to have the same marginal totals that were available for the population. In 1940, the Bureau implemented the first sample long form and needed to have the sample data consistent with that from the complete census long form for selected marginals. Their answer, which they published in a 1940 paper, was to apply least squares to minimize the weighted sum of squared discrepancies between the adjusted frequencies and the sample frequencies, subject to the marginal contraints using Lagrange multipliers. They weighted the individual squared discrepancies by the inverse of the sample cell counts (thus using a chi-square-like metric). Their method could be viewed as a form of post-sratification which generalized ratio adjustment, an approach which handles one set of margins only. This method generalized to three and higher dimensions where adjustments were made for one way and even two-way totals, but the solution of the normal equations proved computationally daunting. Thus Deming and Stephan suggested an approximation which they described as the method of iterative proportions, which successively rescaled the sample data by a proportional adjustment to have the correct margins and iterated until convergence. This approximate method proved workable and soon became the method of choice at the Census Bureau under the label ``raking.'' Deming included a chapter on this method in his 1943 book. Stephan, after some further interaction with Deming, published a second paper on the topic in 1942, in which he proposed an alternative iterative method that actually produced the least squares solution for this problem and noted that the method of iterative proportions did not actually solve the least squares problem and that there was no proof of convergence for more than two dimensions. There the problem lay, until Yvonne Bishop, in work on the National Halothane Study (see Bishop, 1969), noted that the method of iterative proportions solved the loglinear model estimation problem for contingency tables. At about the same time several others found various ways to exploit the algorithm (e.g., see the uses and related references presented in Bishop, et al., 1975). \vspace{.5 cm} \noindent{\bf Deming on Sampling and its Applications} Deming's work on sampling went beyond that linked to the statistical adjustment of data and methods worked on while he was at the Bureau of the Census. His books on sampling (1950) and the design of business research (1960) both had considerable impact on the applications of sampling beyond government, as did his expository articles on sampling such as Deming (1968). He wrote about nonsampling errors, and he applied the notion of capture-recapture to human populations (Sekar and Deming, 1948), linking the approach to sampling and stratification. After the method had been promulgated by others at the Bureau of the Census and elsewhere, he worked with the demographer Nathan Keyfitz to extend capture-recapture ideas to multiple recaptures, but without making the link to loglinear models and his method of iterative proportions. Beginning in the 1950s, Deming referred to himself professionally as a ``Consultant in Statistical Surveys,'' and he consulted widely with those in government and in industry. He was among the first statisticians to testify as an expert witness in court about the results of sample surveys. He wrote on this topic as early as 1954, and he included an example drawing on this work in his 1960 book. In 1958 Deming presented a Special Invited Address on "Principles of Professional Statistical Practice" at the Boston meeting of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (see Deming, 1965). This was one of the first papers to appear in the statistical literature which emphasized the professional ethics associated with the practice of statistics, and much of what he wrote then and subsequently on the topic served as the foundation for codes of ethics developed both by the American Statistical Association and the International Statistical Institute. \vspace{1cm} \begin{thebibliography} Bishop, Y.M.M.

<p><b>Abraham DE MOIVRE</b><br />
b. 26 May 1667 - d. 27 November 1754<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> The first textbook of a calculus of probabilities to contain a form of local central limit theorem grew out of the activities of the lonely Huguenot de Moivre who was forced up to old age to make his living by solving problems of games of chance and of annuities on lives for his clients whom he used to meet in a London coffeehouse.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Due to the fact that he was born as Abraham Moivre and educated in France for the first 18 years of his life and that he later changed his name and his nationality in order to become, as a Mr. de Moivre, an English citizen, biographical interest in him seems to be relatively restricted compared with his significance as one of the outstanding mathematicians of his time. Nearly all contemporary biographical information on de Moivre goes back to his biography of Matthew Maty, member, later secretary of the Royal Society, and a close friend of de Moivre's in old age.</p>
<p>Abraham Moivre stemmed from a Protestant family. His father was a Protestant surgeon from Vitry-le-François in the Champagne. From the age of five to eleven he was educated by the Catholic Péres de la doctrine Chrètienne. Then he moved to the Protestant Academy at Sedan were he mainly studied Greek. After the latter was forced to close in 1681 for its profession of faith, Moivre continued his studies at Saumur between 1682 and 1684 before joining his parents who had meanwhile moved to Paris. At that time he had studied some books on elementary mathematics and the first six books of Euclid's elements. He had even tried his hands on the small tract concerning games of chance of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=49" name="menu0">Christiaan Huygens</a> (q.v.), <i>De ratiociniis in ludo aleae</i>, from 1657 without mastering it completely. In Paris he was taught mathematics by Jacques Ozanam who had made a reputation from a series of books on practical mathematics and mathematical recreations. Ozanam made his living as a private teacher of mathematics. He had extended the usual teachings of the European reckoningmasters and mathematical practitioners by what was considered as fashionable mathematics in Paris. Ozanam enjoyed a moderate financial success due to the many students he attracted. It seems plausible that young Moivre took him as a model he wanted to follow when he had to support himself. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 the protestant faith was not tolerated anymore in France. Hundreds of thousands of Huguenots who had refused to become catholic left France to emigrate in Protestant countries. Amongst them was Moivre who arrived in England, presumably in 1687. In England he began his occupation as a tutor in mathematics. Here he added a "de" to his name. The most plausible reason for this change is that Moivre wanted to take advantage of the prestige of a (pretended) noble birth in France in dealing with his clients many of whom were noblemen. An anecdote from this time which goes back to (de) Moivre himself tells that he cut out the pages of Newton's <i>Principia</i> of 1687 and read them while waiting for his students or walking from one to the other. True or not, the main function of this anecdote was to demonstrate that de Moivre was amongst the first true and loyal Newtonians and that as such he deserved help and protection in order to gain a better position than that of a humble tutor of mathematics. In 1692 de Moivre met with Edmond Halley and shortly afterwards with Newton. Halley cared for the publication of de Moivre's first paper on Newton's doctrine of fluxions in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> for 1695 and saw to his election to the Royal Society in 1697. Only much later in 1735 de Moivre was elected fellow of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and five months before his death the Paris Academy made him a foreign associate member. Looking at Newton's influence concerning university positions for mathematics and natural philosophy in England and Scotland it seemed profitable to de Moivre to engage in the solution of problems posed by the new infinitesimal calculus. In 1697 and 1698 he had published the polynomial theorem, a generalization of Newton's binomial theorem, together with application in the theory of series. This theorem was the background for a quarrel with the Scotch physician George Cheyne who had published a book in 1703 on Newton's method of fluents. De Moivre's critical remarks concerning Cheyne's book filled another book which was published in 1704. This first book of de Moivre was no success but stimulated a correspondence with Johann Bernoulli which lasted until 1714. He had tried to secure the support of Johann Bernoulli and Leibniz in order to get a professorship on the continent. De Moivre did not answer Bernoulli's last letter. It seems that de Moivre who was made a member of the commission in the Royal Society to decide in the priority dispute between Newton and Leibniz against Leibniz feared to appear disloyal to the Newtonian cause had he continued this correspondence. At any rate, the letters of Johann Bernoulli had shown to de Moivre that he lacked the time and perhaps the mathematical power to compete with a mathematician of this calibre in the new field of analysis. In addition, when the Lucasian chair in Cambridge for mathematics had been given in 1711 on Newton's recommendation to Nicholas Saunderson de Moivre had realized, that the only chance for him to survive was to continue his occupation as a tutor and consultant in mathematical affairs in the world of the coffee houses where he used to meet his clients; additional income he could draw from the publication of books and from translations. So he turned to the calculus of games of chance and probability theory which was of great interest for many of his students and where he had only a few competitors. In this respect it was easy for him to become a pioneer in a field which, apart from two episodes, he could claim for himself. In both cases he was involved in rather fierce disputes about mutual dependence with other authors in the field. De Moivre could treat the first of these, Montmort (q.v.), for personal and political reasons as an enemy without it being resented in England because Montmort was French and France had expelled de Moivre who had become a naturalized Englishman in 1705 and who had experienced the defeat of the French armies in the war of Spanish succession with grim satisfaction. Montmort had published a book on games of chance, the <i>Essay d'Analyse sur les Jeux de Hazard</i>, in 1708 and reacted to de Moivre's first publication in the field in the second edition of the <i>Essay</i> which appeared in 1713/14. The second opponent was the Englishman Thomas Simpson, who with two books from 1740 and 1742 had plagiarized de Moivre's <i>Doctrine of Chances</i> and <i>Annuities on Lives</i>.</p>
<p>Simpson, a former fortuneteller and weaver from Leistershire with the typical mentality of a social climber had come to London in 1736. Here he began immediately to qualify for the market of mathematically interested clients by turning out a textbook on the theory of fluxions in 1737 which was the first in a whole series of mostly very successful mathematical textbooks. De Moivre's anger and his acrimonious reaction to Simpson who had intruded into his proper domain is understandable but did not meet with general applause. In a way fortunately for de Moivre, Simpson was more successful in his efforts to get a permanent position and so dropped out from the competition for private clients in London.</p>
<p>Next to his clients it was Montmort who had raised de Moivre's interest in the theory of games of chance and probability. In the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> for 1711 de Moivre published a longer article on the subject which was followed by his <i>Doctrine of Chances</i>. The <i>Doctrine</i> appeared in 1718, a second edition from 1738 contained de Moivre's normal approximation to the binomial distribution which he had found in 1733. The third edition from 1756 contained as a second part the <i>Annuities on Lives</i> which had been published as a monograph for the first time in 1725.</p>
<p>De Moivre's preoccupation with questions concerning the conduct of a capitalist society like interest, loan, mortgage, pensions, reversions or annuities goes back at least to the 90's of the 17th century from which time a piece of paper is kept in Berlin containing de Moivre's answers to pertinent questions of a client. Halley had reconstructed from the lists of births and deaths in Breslau for each of the years 1687-1691 the demographic structure of the population of Breslau, which he assumed as stationary, in form of a life table. Halley's life table was published in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> for 1693 together with applications to annuities on lives. Besides the formulas for the values of an annuity for a single life and for several lives he had calculated a table for the values of annuities of a single life for every fifth year of age at an interest rate of 6%. The immense calculation hindered him from doing the same for two and more lives. De Moivre solved this problem by a simplification. He replaced Halley's life table by a (piecewise) linear function. Based on such a hypothetical law of mortality and fixed rates of interest he could derive formulas for annuities of single lives and approximations for annuities of joint lives as a function of the corresponding annuities on single lives. These results were published together with the solution of problems of reversionary annuities, annuities on successive lives, tontines, and of other contracts which are depending on interest and the “probability of the duration of life" in his book <i>Annuities upon lives</i> which appeared for the first time in 1725. In the second edition of the <i>Doctrine of chances</i> part of the material contained in the <i>Annuities</i> together with new material was incorporated. After three more improved editions of the <i>Annuities</i> in 1743, 1750, and 1752 the last version of it was published in the third edition of the <i>Doctrine</i>. The <i>Doctrine</i> can be considered as the result of a competition between de Moivre on the one hand and Montmort together with <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=74" name="menu1">Nicolaus Bernoulli</a> (q.v.) on the other. De Moivre's representation of the solution of the then current problems tended to be more general than that of Montmort. In addition he developed a series of algebraic and analytic tools for the theory of probability like a “new algebra" for the solution of the problem of coincidences which forshadowed Boolean algebra, the method of generating functions or the theory of recurring series for the solution of difference equations. Different from Montmort, de Moivre offered in the <i>Doctrine</i> an introduction which contains the main concepts like probability, conditional probability, expectation, dependent and independent events, the multiplication rule, and the binomial distribution. De Moivre's greatest mathematical achievement is considered a form of the central limit theorem which he found in 1733 at the age of 66. There is no doubt that de Moivre understood the importance of this special finding. From a technical point of view de Moivre understood his central limit theorem as a generalization and a sharpenning of Bernoulli's <i>Theorema aureum</i> which was later named the law of large numbers by Poisson.</p>
<p>Already in his commentary on Huygens (q.v.), <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu2" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=52" name="menu2">Jakob Bernoulli</a> (q.v.) had introduced the binomial distribution. With it he had shown that the relative frequency <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ h_n$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img1.png" title="$ h_n$" width="25" /></span> of an event with probability <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img2.png" title="$ p$" width="14" /></span> in <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img3.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> independent trials converges in probability to <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ p$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img4.png" title="$ p$" width="14" /></span> . More precisely he had shown that for any given small positive numbers <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \delta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img5.png" title="$ \delta$" width="14" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \epsilon$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img6.png" title="$ \epsilon$" width="12" /></span> then for sufficiently large <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img7.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> ,</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle P(\vert h_{n} - p\vert \leq \epsilon) &gt; 1 - {\delta}. $" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img8.png" title="$\displaystyle P(\vert h_{n} - p\vert \leq \epsilon) &gt; 1 - {\delta}. $" width="201" /></div>
de Moivre, however, was interested in the precise determination of these probabilities and, by considering the ratios of binomial probabilities, he was able to show that for large <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img9.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> :
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle P(\vert h_{n} - p\vert \leq s\surd(pq/n)) \approx \surd(2/{\pi}) \int_{0}^{s} e^{ -x^2/2} dx $" border="0" height="61" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img10.png" title="$\displaystyle P(\vert h_{n} - p\vert \leq s\surd(pq/n)) \approx \surd(2/{\pi}) \int_{0}^{s} e^{ -x^2/2} dx $" width="387" /></div>
although he did not use this representation. He calculated the value of the integral on the right hand side for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ s = 1,2,3$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/24/l2h/img11.png" title="$ s = 1,2,3$" width="83" /></span> . It is clear that he intuitively understood the importance of what was later called the standard deviation.
<p>The approximation of the binomial through the normal distribution with its consequences was the culmination of the <i>Doctrine</i> from the second edition on. This book, especially the last edition of 1756,was the most complete representation of the new field in the second half of the 18th century. That this was felt by the leading mathematicians of the next generation is clear in that Lagrange and Laplace (q.v.) independently planned translations of de Moivre's <i>Doctrine</i>.</p>
<p>The interest of Lagrange and Laplace in de Moivre's work goes back to de Moivre's solution of the problem of the duration of play by means of what de Moivre called recurrent series and what amounts to the solution of a homogeneous linear difference equation with constant coefficients. In fact, the most effective analytical tool developed by Laplace for the calculus of probabilities, the theory of generating functions, is a consequence of Laplace's occupation with recurrent series.</p>
<p>However, Laplace restricted his praise of de Moivre's theory of probability to mathematical achievements like the theory of recurrent series, the central limit theorem and the hint to the generality which distinguishes the problems and their solutions chosen by de Moivre from those of his predecessors. Many other features of the <i>Doctrine of chances</i> like the interpretation of the central limit theorem concerning the relationship of probability and chance remained unmentioned by Laplace presumably because his generation did not share anymore de Moivre's views on theology and natural philosophy. De Moivre seemed to understand very different connotations of the term chance. In the first remark to his central limit theorem concerning the tossing of a coin he states, "that Chance very little disturbs the Events which in their natural Institution were designed to happen or fail, according to some determinate Law." It seems clear that chance is used in this sentence as an antithesis to law which conforms to what is called statistical law. The existence of laws of this kind is due to a "design" which again, according to contemporary convictions, at least amongst "natural" theologians, relates immediately to divine providence. Chance in contrast appears as something which obscures this design by "irregularity". Irregularity had to do with the unpredictability of the outcome in single trials and interrelated with that with deviations of a regular pattern according to which e. g. all six sides of a die should show up in some order in a series of six throws.</p>
<p>De Moivre did not analyse this irregularity which characterizes chance any further. However, his understanding of the concept of chance can be clarified with the help of remarks on the central limit theorem which appear only in the third edition of the <i>Doctrine of Chances</i>. He had taken the view that irregularity and unpredictability in a small number of trials, but not in the long run inherent in the concept of chance, are consistent with his repeated reference to divine design and providence. In order to understand this we must take into account that de Moivre's and Newton's creator had not abandoned his creation after its perfection but ruled it permanently in order to guarantee its existence. Therefore de Moivre's God is allwise and allpowerful; nothing happens outside his control and involvement. If one considers the status of probabilities as laws which express God's design, two conclusions are forthcoming. First, probabilities are objective properties of creation. Secondly, chance, too, as an existing property of the material world with its irregular and unpredictable aspects, is a manifestation of God's constant involvement in the course of his creation and so is objective in the sense that it is independent of the human subject and its level of information. In a way, further progress beyond such a statement is imaginable neither for de Moivre nor for Newton. Since the supreme goal of scientific enterprise is to demonstrate the existence of an agent, called God, whose constant activity permeates the whole cosmos, de Moivre with his interpretation of the interplay between law or design, which reveals the existence of God, and chance, which represents his constant activity, has reached this goal. In this sense de Moivre's chance has the same status as action at a distance in Newton's physics. Neither concept is explained by a reduction to more elementary concepts. This view differed completely from that of Jakob Bernoulli and Laplace. Both shared a credo in a completely determined world the events of which strictly follow certain laws which can be described in mathematical terms.<br />

<p><b>Augustus DE MORGAN</b><br />
b. 27 June 1806 - d. 18 March 1871<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. De Morgan is chiefly remembered today for his work in algebra and logic. He also made noteworthy contributions to probability theory, most especially concerning its use in actuarial mathematics. He headed the British logical probabilistic tradition, exemplified by Boole, Jevons and Venn.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>De Morgan was born in Madurai, southern India. Raised and educated in southwest England, he entered Trinity College Cambridge, at the early age of sixteen, in February 1823. Graduating in 1827, he applied for the mathematics chair at the newly-established and explicitly secular University College London. At 21, with no teaching experience whatsoever, he was the youngest of thirty-one candidates. Nevertheless, he was unanimously elected founding professor of mathematics on 23 February 1828, giving his first lecture on 5 November that year.</p>
<p>All did not go smoothly, however, and when, in 1831, a fellow professor was unfairly dismissed, De Morgan promptly resigned in protest. Five years later, however, following the accidental death of his successor, De Morgan immediately offered himself as a temporary replacement. He was to remain for thirty more years.</p>
<p>As professor of mathematics, De Morgan taught everything from elementary arithmetic and the first book of Euclid's <span class="textit">Elements</span> to the calculus of variations in an intensive two-year programme of study. While his course was almost entirely `pure', a few items of applied mathematics were included. For example, in his highest class he would introduce the use of probability in error theory. Briefly stated, this assumes that in good observational experiments, any errors will be very small, so that one can be certain that all results will be contained within a boundary of, say, <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \pm E$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img1.png" title="$ \pm E$" width="35" /></span></p>
<blockquote>Let the law of probability of error be expressed by there being the chance <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ % \varphi x.dx$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img2.png" title="$ % \varphi x.dx$" width="53" /></span> that, in an observation about to be made, the error shall be between <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img3.png" title="$ x$" width="15" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ x+dx$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img4.png" title="$ x+dx$" width="59" /></span> . Then, to express the above certainty, we have</blockquote>
<div align="center"><span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \int_{-E}^{E}$" border="0" height="46" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img5.png" title="$ \int_{-E}^{E}$" width="36" /></span> <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \varphi x.dx=1$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img6.png" title="$ \varphi x.dx=1$" width="88" /></span> .</div>
<p>As with much of the material in his highest class, De Morgan's teaching of the theory of errors of observation was heavily influenced by the work of Gauss (q.v.) a few decades before. Moreover, the main topics covered by De Morgan's lecture notes in this area, such as the weight of observations and the method of least squares, were all introduced by Gauss in his <span class="textit">Theoria motus corporum celestium</span> (1809) and <span class="textit">Theoria combinationis observationum erroribus minimis obnoxiæ</span> (1823).</p>
<p>Other remarks from various works reveal that his students were exposed to other aspects of probability theory by their professor. In an article on Buffon's (q.v.) needle experiment, De Morgan reveals that “a pupil of mine made 600 trials with a rod of the length between the seams and got <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \pi =$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img7.png" title="$ \pi =$" width="36" /></span> 3.137”. Isaac Todhunter, one of De Morgan's students in the 1840s, wrote a standard history of the subject in 1865 in which he provided strong evidence of the encouragement he received from his former teacher during its preparation. In the opening preface, “sincere thanks” are expressed to De Morgan “for the kind interest in which he has taken in my work, for the loan of scarce books, and for the suggestion of valuable references”.</p>
<p>De Morgan was, throughout his career, a prolific writer, publishing 18 books and over 160 papers on many subjects. His research is primarily remembered today for its contribution to the development of modern symbolic algebra and logic, encouraging William Rowan Hamilton with his work on quaternions and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=9" name="menu0">George Boole</a> in his algebraic logic. Indeed, De Morgan's major achievement lies in his recognition of the connection between the two disciplines. As he later characteristically put it:</p>
<blockquote>We know that mathematicians care no more for logic than logicians for mathematics. The two eyes of exact science are mathematics and logic: the mathematical sect puts out the logical eye, the logical sect puts out the mathematical eye; each believing that it sees better with one eye than with two.</blockquote>
<p>He published two books and four papers based on his research into logic, of which the fourth is now regarded as his most original contribution. In it, he introduced the logic of relations which, although his work in this area was left unfinished, substantially increased the scope of the subject. Less enduring perhaps were his attempts to invent a suitable notation for his symbolic logic which were superseded by Boole's more algebraic approach. An illustration of this is provided by the fact that the famous De Morgan's Laws are far more familiar to us in their modern Boolean formulation:</p>
<div align="center"><span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (A\cup B)^{c}=A^{c}\cap B^{c}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img8.png" title="$ (A\cup B)^{c}=A^{c}\cap B^{c}$" width="165" /></span> , <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (A\cap B)^{c}=A^{c}\cup B^{c}$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img9.png" title="$ (A\cap B)^{c}=A^{c}\cup B^{c}$" width="165" /></span> .</div>
<p>Perhaps De Morgan's best known work is a book entitled <span class="textit">A Budget of Paradoxes</span>. This is a collection of humorous writings and reviews compiled posthumously by his widow Sophia (a woman of no small intellect herself, although she was not a mathematician). De Morgan was a keen bibliophile, accumulating over 3000 mathematical volumes by his death, and the <span class="textit">Budget</span> consists of accounts of many of these works together with various anecdotes and witty verses, of which the following is perhaps his most famous:</p>
<div align="center">Great fleas have little fleas, upon their backs to bite 'em,</div>

<p>De Morgan was a man of many eccentricities. When asked his age, he reportedly declared: “I was <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img10.png" title="$ x$" width="15" /></span> years old in the year <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ x^{2}.$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/25/l2h/img11.png" title="$ x^{2}.$" width="28" /></span> ” In 1859, when offered an honorary law doctorate by Edinburgh University, he declined it, saying that he “did not feel like an LL.D.” He also refused to allow himself to be proposed as a Fellow of the Royal Society. “Whether I could have been a Fellow,” he later said, “I cannot know; as the gentleman said who was asked if he could play the violin, I never tried.”</p>
<p>The last major event of his career was his term as first president of the London Mathematical Society (LMS), founded in 1865. Due no doubt to his reputation and influence, membership of the new society rose steadily from the outset, and, to this day, the Society commemorates its founding president with the conferment of the De Morgan Medal, awarded every three years for outstanding mathematical achievement.</p>
<p>De Morgan's long association with University College ended soon after the foundation of the LMS, occasioned by another matter of principle, this time over adherence to the college's policy of religious neutrality. For De Morgan, the council's refusal to appoint a candidate to the vacant chair of philosophy on the grounds of his being a controversial Unitarian minister was a betrayal of its founding principles. He resigned his professorship on 10 November 1866, giving his last lecture in the summer of 1867. He never returned, explaining that, as far as he was concerned, “our old College no longer exists”. He died four years later.</p>
<p>Although in comparison to his output in other areas De Morgan's work on probability was small, it is not insignificant. His chief works are a book-length article for the <span class="textit">Encyclopædia Metropolitana</span> in 1837, and a volume entitled <span class="textit">An Essay on Probabilities</span>, published in 1838. These two works, though bearing similar titles, were vastly different in content. The first was, in the author's words: “A Mathematical Treatise on the Theory of Probabilities; containing such development of the application of Mathematics to the said Theory as shall to him (the Author) seem fit, and in particular such a view of the higher parts of the subject as laid down by Laplace in his work entitled <span class="textit">Théorie des Probabilités</span>, as can be contained in a reasonable compass, regard being had to the extent and character of the Mathematical portions of the said work.” In a contemporary review of Laplace's (q.v.) <span class="textit">Théorie</span>, De Morgan described it as</p>
<blockquote>the Mont Blanc of mathematical analysis; but the mountain has this advantage over the book, that there are guides always ready near the former, whereas the student has been left to his own method of encountering the latter.</blockquote>
<p>De Morgan's own treatise, while it contained no original results, was nevertheless the first major exposition of the subject to be published in Britain, and as such, it constituted the first major work on modern probability theory to appear in the English language.</p>
<p>The second work was concerned with actuarial mathematics, and in particular, to the application of probability to problems in insurance. In the early 19th century, the actuarial profession was still in its infancy. Consequently, able mathematicians with an understanding of actuarial methods, had the potential to follow very lucrative careers in the insurance business. De Morgan therefore ensured an increased revenue by acting as a free-lance consultant to a variety of companies; in fact his last major mathematical undertaking was a large calculation for the Alliance Insurance Company in 1867. We are told that as an actuary “he occupied the first place, though he was not directly associated with any particular office; but his opinion was sought for by professional actuaries on all sides, on the more difficult questions connected with the theory of probabilities, as applied to life-contingencies”. His book on the subject, being the first of its kind, remained highly regarded in insurance literature for well over a generation.</p>
<p>As such it was far less technically demanding than the former work. However, the publishers of the <span class="textit">Encyclopædia Metropolitana</span> did not see this distinction and threatened legal action, accusing De Morgan of having broken the terms of his contract with the <span class="textit">Encyclopædia</span> by publishing what they claimed “might be deemed a second edition of the treatise”. De Morgan, who was apparently more amused than irritated by this, later published a small pamphlet in which he ridiculed the publishers for “throwing away good grumbling upon nothing at all” through their inability to see the very obvious difference between a work requiring a thorough knowledge of integral calculus and a popular essay needing only decimal fractions.</p>
<p>Curiously, another elementary work on probability with which De Morgan was associated had nothing to do with him at all. This was an anonymous book titled <span class="textit">On Probability</span>. The book, authored by the British mathematicians Sir John Lubbock and John Drinkwater-Bethune, was published in 1830, seven years before De Morgan's first major work on probability; yet he was frequently credited as the author, despite his frequent disclaimers. As he later wrote: “nothing could drive out of people's heads that it was written by me. I do not know how many denials I have made ... and I am not sure that I have succeeded in establishing the truth, even now.”</p>
<p>In statistics, De Morgan was less active. He does not appear to have joined the Statistical Society (founded in 1834), and his biographer tells us that when “the International Statistical Congress was held in London in 1860, ... he joined a Committee for the inspection, I think, of Scientific Instruments, but he did not give much work to this.” Nevertheless, his work does evince a knowledge and appreciation of statistical methods. This is particularly evident in his <span class="textit">Essay</span>, which, in a number of places, contains analysis of data from various publications, including a couple of then-recent works by Quetelet (q.v.).</p>
<p>De Morgan's contributions, then, to probability theory in Britain were twofold. Firstly, he provided the British with the first full treatment of Laplacean probability theory in their own language, showing himself to be one of the few mainstream British proponents of the subject during the mid-19th century; and secondly, by advocating its practical utility in the growing field of insurance he helped establish it as the basis of modern actuarial methods, which it has remained ever since.<br />

<p><b>Sir Frederick Morton EDEN</b><br />
b. 18 June 1766 - d. 14 November 1809<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> At the end of the eighteenth century, Eden's concern with poverty, and with policies and insurance against it, was expressed in pioneeringly extensive analyses and synthesis of carefully assembled data.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The published works of Sir Frederick Morton Eden on the pressing social issues of his day are arguably without precedent in their combination of scope, volume, and quality.</p>
<p>In 1797 came <i>The State of the Poor</i> - a massive history of the Poor Laws, capped by over 900 pages of colourful and sorrowfull documentation of widespread poverty, based on Eden's own statistical survey of 181 parishes in England and Wales. The next year, he brought out a slim yet innovative pamphlet, <i>Portobello: or a Plan for the Improvement of the Port and City of London</i>, in which he made good use of frequency distributions of ship tonnages.</p>
<p>In 1800 the curious public was given <i>An Estimate of the Number of Inhabitants in Great Britain and Ireland</i>, well in advance of the publication of the first population census. In 1801 Eden returned to his concern with poverty, in his <i>Observations on Friendly Societies</i>, and again, in 1806, with his second major work, the “charter pamphlet" <i>On the Policy and Expediency of Granting Insurance Charters</i>. In these two publications, Eden promoted the provision of insurance by Friendly Societies, backed by the resources of joint-stock companies, as superior to any State-administered schemes for helping the “labouring classes" to surmount the natural calamities of life. Only one of the titles of Eden's publications reveals the empirical statistical character of his work, a feature which Eden has in common with <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=78" name="menu0">Florence Nightingale</a> (q.v.), the “Passionate Statistician". The striking difference between the two lies in what is known about the influences that moved them to achieve what they did.</p>
<p>Nightingale was manifestly fired with analytical zeal from adolescence, and she built up a huge reservoir of motivation from her experiences in the Crimean War. By contrast, biographical details about Eden are so lacking that, until more is revealed and written about the man, it would be futile to try to locate the firing of his investigative genius, which shone brightly even against a family background of public service. Was his thoughtful, analytical bent moulded by his life in America between the ages of three and perhaps six, as the eldest son of the last British Governor of Maryland? - by the return with his mother alone to be educated in England? - by the sudden early death of his father? Was it triggered into action by knowledge that children were being sent to work down the early coalmines of County Durham, where the family had their “seat"? - or more reflectively, by wide reading about the Poor?</p>
<p>What is known for sure is that when, in 1795, he initiated his survey for <i>The State of the Poor</i>, he had a library with almost 300 books and pamphlets dealing with problems of the Poor and the ironically rich philosophy associated with them, but no more than 40 items under the heads of Cooking, Games and Sports, interests traditionally associated with the landed gentry. In the preface to <i>The State of the Poor</i>, Eden identified, with a liberal supply of commas, the immediate stimulus to his inquiry;</p>
<blockquote>“The difficulties, which the labouring classes experienced, from the high price of grain, and of provisions in general, as well as of cloathing (sic!) and fuel, during the years 1794 and 1795, induced me, from motives both of benevolence and personal curiosity, to investigate their conditions in various parts of the kingdom."</blockquote>
<p>The statistical findings reported in <i>The State of the Poor</i>, about population. housing, rent, taxes, prices, wages, food consumption, and much more, have been of considerable value to later economists. Even Karl Marx, not wont to praise others, hailed Eden as the only disciple of Adam Smith throughout the eighteenth century to produce work of any importance.</p>
<p>Eden set out his statistical stall quite openly: he criticixed “writers on the Poor" for “making bricks without straw" and raising “specious systems without well authenticated facts to support them". But Eden would not have been in the party of those founders of the Statistical Section of the British Association (the Royal Statistical Society in embryo) who wanted “to exclude all Opinions" and “confine...attention rigorously to facts...which can be stated numerically and arranged in tables". For Eden, as for Nightingale, figures had to be collected so that the calculations based on them would answer some perssing question and advance some desired reform - all of which needs “opinions".</p>
<p>Eden had doubts about the 21 questions in his survey...“I will not assert that my Queries are the best calculated to acquire the information I wanted". He quoted with approval Rousseau's discouraging maxim that one needs to know a lot before knowing how to find out what one does not know.</p>
<p>Eden was even a rational sceptic about his own efforts to estimate population, for which the issue was the current fear,during the war with France, of a declining population:...“He who looks for more than probabilities will be disappointed." His statistical method for England and Wales was a sophisticated early example of ratio estimation; its details can easily be misrepresented. Eden's estimate of 16 millions for the British Isles came to within 1% of the 1801 census, but only by a fortuitous cancellation of an error od more than 1 1/2 millions in the ratio estimate with an error in his guesswork for Scotland and Ireland!</p>
<p>Perhaps Eden's boldest “casting" stemmed from his role as founder and chairman of the Globe Insurance Company. In 1803 he asked himself “What is the total insurable value of property in the whole of the United Kingdom, and how much of it is actually insured?" The calculation is set out over 20 pages of the charter pamphlet. It involved listing 23 property categories, estimating their insurance values, making the usual guess for Ireland, adding the lot, and estimating the total actually insured from records of stamp duty.</p>
<p>Eden may have erred in occasional detail, but he never lacked vision or appeared to doubt that statistical analyses could add grace and light to political debate on issues of social reform. This was not the view of Disreali, born in the same year as Eden. Statisticians nowadays might wish that Eden had lived long enough to roast Disraeli's chesnut - before it had taken root - about lies, damned lies, and worse. Eden would have been well qualified to do so. But he died, on the 14th of November 1809 at the Chairman's desk of the Globe Insurance Company.<br />

<p><b>Francis Ysidro EDGEWORTH</b><br />
b. 8 February 1845 - d. 13 February 1926<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> His writings reflecting the advantages of a classical education, Edgeworth made contributions to the moral sciences, economics, probability and statistics. His early and important work on index numbers and utility was followed by later statistical work now perhaps seen as `Bayesian'.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>What is one to make of an author whose disparate writings cover topics from Matthew Arnold's interpretation of Butler to the generalized law of error, via index numbers, the theory of banking, correlation, least squares, the labours of Hymenoptera, hedonism and examination statistics? And how much more difficult is any comprehension, let alone assessment, when classical tags abound, when neologisms are rife, and when an English style awkward to the modern eye prevails! This is the kind of problem besetting one commenting on Edgeworth.</p>
<p>Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (for this is the way the world knows him, despite his Christian names being registered in the reverse order) was born in Edgeworthstown, County Longford, Ireland, on the 8th February 1845. His grandfather, Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744-1817), keenly interested in the applications of science to industry, perfected a number of inventions which won him gold and silver medals from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts and, in 1761, a Fellowship of the Royal Society. Richard worshipped at the altar of Hymen to the extent of four marriages, with twenty-two offspring issuing in forty-eight years. His second child and eldest daughter, Maria, became a well-known novelist, and their circle of friends included people such as Jeremy Bentham, Sir William Rowan Hamilton, Sir John Herschel, Thomas Malthus (q.v.), David Ricardo and Sir Walter Scott. Francis Ysidro's father, Francis Beaufort (1809-1846), was the son of Richard and his last wife, Frances Anne Beaufort, a woman of Huguenot extraction and the sister of the inventor of the Beaufort Wind Scale. At the age of twenty-two Francis Beaufort married Rosa Florentina Eroles, a sixteen-year-old Catalan refugee. After a few years in Florence and the failure of a private tutoring establishment in Eltham near London, Francis Beaufort returned to Ireland to manage the family estates, where Francis Ysidro was born some eighteen months before his father's death during the Irish Famine.</p>
<p>As might be expected, fecundity such as that described above resulted in complex family ties, and Francis Ysidro was distantly related to Sir George Gabriel Stokes and Sir <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=38" name="menu0">Francis Galton</a> (q.v.). However emigration to the New World and mortality took their toll of the bearers of the Edgeworth name, and despite his being only the fifth son of a sixth son, Francis Ysidro inherited the family estates (by then almost impoverished) in 1911. He never married, and his death on the 13th February 1926 saw the end of the male line in Europe.</p>
<p>At seventeen, after having been privately tutored from childhood, Francis Ysidro entered Trinity College Dublin to read modern languages. He seems to have taken no degree there, and in 1867 he moved to Oxford. After short spells at Exeter and Magdalen Halls, he was admitted to Balliol in 1868. A first in Greats (Literae Humaniores) was awarded in 1869, though the degree was not conferred until 1873, the formal M.A. following in 1877.</p>
<p>It appears that Edgeworth moved to London on leaving Oxford, where some private study must have followed; for in 1877 he was admitted to the Bar by the Inner Temple, though he is not known to have practised.</p>
<p>Edgeworth held various minor lecturing posts in London until he became Professor of Political Economy at King's College in 1888, succeeding Thorold Rogers in 1890 as Tooke Professor of Economic Science and Statistics. In 1891 he again followed Rogers, this time as Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford, where he became a Fellow of All Souls College and remained until his retirement with emeritus status in 1922.</p>
<p>The stimulus for Edgeworth's interest in literature, science and mathematics is evident in his family background, and his training at Trinity and Oxford may account for his penchant for classical quotation. He himself wrote “After leaving Oxford, I studied mathematics for some years" (Newman [1987, p. 85]), and his emphasis on the calculus of variations and his aesthetic views on mathematics may both be ascribable to Hamilton's influence (mathematical <i>reasoning</i> or <i>rhetoric</i> was always important to Edgeworth). Bowley noted, however, that Edgeworth's mathematical work shows a lack of systematic training, with “a want of facility and neatness in his handling of problems", though exhibiting “great insight into the principles of mathematics" [1934, p. 114].</p>
<p>Edgeworth's early interest in ethics resulted in his first major work, <i>New and Old Methods of Ethics</i> in 1877. Here a hedonic calculus (divided into economics and utilitarianism) is established, and the importance of optimization stressed.</p>
<p>From the measurement of pleasure Edgeworth was led naturally to the measurement of utility (and consequently to an interest in economics), then to the measurement of belief, and thence to probability and statistics.</p>
<p>Edgeworth's work in the moral sciences was perhaps first impelled by his contact at Balliol with Benjamin Jowett, though the interest in economics is probably more directly attributable to the association with his close neighbour in Hampstead, <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=54" name="menu1">William Stanley Jevons</a> (q.v.) (contact with Alfred Marshall followed at a later date). In 1881 Edgeworth published what was perhaps his most important contribution to economics: <i>Mathematical Psychics: an essay on the application of mathematics to the moral sciences</i>, a work essential to the understanding of Edgeworth's later writings and described by Keynes (q.v.) as an “amalgam of poetry and pedantry, science and art, wit and learning" [1972, p. 258]. Intended as an essay, from a utilitarian point of view, on “the calculus of <i>Feeling</i>, of Pleasure and Pain", the book was divided into two parts, concerned respectively with the applicability and the application of mathematics to sociology. Here Edgeworth disclosed indifference curves and their relation to the contract curve, his own contributions to utility theory being relegated to the appendices.</p>
<p>While Edgeworth's activities were directed in the main to probability and statistics after 1881, three notable contributions to economic theory were made in the 1890s: “The pure theory of international values" (1894), “The pure theory of monopoly" and “The pure theory of taxation", both in 1897. A major contribution to the subject of index numbers was made by Edgeworth as secretary to the British Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>His third book, <i>Metretike: or The Method of Measuring Probability and Utility</i> (1887), dealt with probability as the basis of inductive reasoning, with both weighted means and the most advantageous mean, and although Keynes states [1972, p. 261] that Edgeworth himself was disappointed with this tract, it perhaps gained importance with the later works of F.P. Ramsey and L.J. Savage.</p>
<p>After this Edgeworth turned his attention more and more to probability and statistics. His most important writings on probability <i>per se</i> are perhaps “The philosophy of chance" (1884) and the article on probability in the eleventh edition of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>. Edgeworth's first paper on statistics was published in 1883. It was devoted to the law of error (our Normal distribution), a topic that was to concern him to the last, and the whole plan of his statistical work can be seen in his important “Methods of Statistics" of 1885.</p>
<p>In 1891 Edgeworth became the first editor of the <i>Economic Journal</i>, and he continued in one or another editorial capacity until his death. As editor he penned a number of reviews of books and articles, frequently with commentary on contemporary work, his own thoughts often being relegated to footnotes.</p>
<p>Edgeworth did not establish a school of followers: his only disciple seems to have been Sir <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu2" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=13" name="menu2">Arthur Lyon Bowley</a> (q.v.), who, on his appointment to the London School of Economics in 1895, consulted Edgeworth for information on the nature and literature of statistics, starting a friendship which lasted until Edgeworth's death. It was in fact Bowley's 1928 tract on Edgeworth's work in mathematical statistics that probably saved this work from oblivion.</p>
<p>Most of Edgeworth's biographers (even Bowley) got to know him only in his middle age, and so opinions of him as a young man are lacking. In 1889 Beatrice Webb (then Potter) described him as “a gentle-natured and intellectual man with queer cramped nature, excessively polite and diffident in manner" (she also said that he was pathetic and that he bored her). Keynes notes Edgeworth's all-embracing tolerance and says “He was kind, affectionate, modest, self-depreciatory, humorous, with a sharp and candid eye for human nature; he was also reserved, angular, complicated, proud, and touchy, elaborately polite, courteous to the point of artificiality, absolutely unbending and unyielding in himself to the pressure of the outside world" [1972, p. 265]. As a lecturer Edgeworth was apparently not a great success: Bowley notes that “the few courses of lectures he gave were not well attended, for indeed he had no faculty for that method of teaching" [1934, p. 1231, while Schumpeter writes that Edgeworth was “the worst speaker and lecturer imaginable" [1954, p. 831].</p>
<p>Edgeworth was perhaps more a philosopher than a practitioner of statistics. Yet in his statistical work (much of which one would today term “Bayesian") one finds essentially the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/27/l2h/img1.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -distribution (his “subexponential" distribution, derived as the posterior for a Normal mean with uniform priors for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \mu$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/27/l2h/img2.png" title="$ \mu$" width="16" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ {\sigma}^{-1}$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/27/l2h/img3.png" title="$ {\sigma}^{-1}$" width="34" /></span> ), the Edgeworth expansion and the Edgeworth series, the method of translation (now called variate transformation) and its extension to bivariate surfaces, the asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimates, the rejection of outhers, stochastic models, <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu3" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu3">tests</a> of goodness-of-fit and an anticipation of a two-way analysis of variance. He also introduced a number of statistical terms, some of which, like “modulus" and “fluctuation" (our <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \surd{2}\sigma$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/27/l2h/img4.png" title="$ \surd{2}\sigma$" width="41" /></span> . and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ 2{\sigma}^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/27/l2h/img5.png" title="$ 2{\sigma}^2$" width="33" /></span> respectively) have to a large extent disappeared, while others, such as the “coefficient of correlation", remain. We are also indebted to him for the `<span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ k$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/27/l2h/img6.png" title="$ k$" width="15" /></span> ' in <i>Biometrika</i>. It is fashionable, if not obligatory, when writing on Edgeworth to comment on the obscurity of his style. However in preparing this note I found that I had to agree with Bowley that “if one studies carefully a treatise as a whole, with some knowledge of Edgeworth's general lines of thought, and then reads it a second time, one finds that the whole is coherent, the arguments valid and consecutive, the theme is made clearer and more vivid by the variations" [1934, pp. 123-124].</p>
<p>Honoured for his work in economics and statistics, Edgeworth received a D.C.L. from Durham University. He was twice president of the Economic Section of the British Association, President of the Royal Statistical Society (receiving the Guy Medal in Gold in 1907), Vice-president of the Royal Economic Society and an original Fellow of the British Academy (1903).<br />

<p><b>Pyotr Dimitrievich EN'KO</b><br />
b. 15 November 1844 - d. 6 March 1916 (o.s.)<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> En'ko was a Russian physician whose probabilistic modelling and data analysis of measles epidemics in the late 1880s anticipated the work of Reed and Frost in the 1920s.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>In 1760, <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=22" name="menu0">Daniel Bernoulli</a> (q.v.) produced a model for the number of susceptibles in a cohort of individuals exposed to smallpox; this model did not involve what is now understood as the spread of infection by homogeneous mixing (mass action) in a susceptible population. Dietz (1988) has made an excellent case for Pyotr Dimitrievich En'ko's paper (1889) as the first to discuss the elements of a genuine epidemic model, namely the chain binomial; this was developed some forty years later by Reed and Frost in the USA (see Abbey, 1952 and Frost, 1976).</p>
<p>En'ko was born in St. Petersburg in 1844, the son of a member of the nobility in the Chernigov region, and a Saxon mother. In an autobiographical sketch (in Pushkin's Dom at the Vengerov Archives, St. Petersburg), En'ko mentions that the family rose in the 17th and 18th centuries to achieve wealth and social importance. He was first educated at the school attached to the Imperial Medical and Surgical Academy of St. Petersburg, where he was greatly influenced by his mathematics teacher, and by the school principal Bardovskiy. The best pupils were encouraged to pursue topics outside the school curriculum, and to read widely in the school's excellent library. He later studied medicine at the Academy itself, and graduated from it in 1867. He began his medical career as an intern at the Zagorodnaya Hospital in 1869, and in 1871 transferred to the St. Petersburg Alexander Institute, whose senior doctor he became in 1874. He worked as a physician among children, and in his book, Moshkovskiy (1950) mentions that he was concerned with “the clinical and epidemiological aspects of children's infections, physiology and the hygiene of schools".</p>
<p>En'ko organized the first institutional medical station in Lipetsk, south of Moscow in 1885, remaining at its head for several years. He then set up a similar station in Gapsal. In 1901 he was named Director of the Imperial School for Deaf-Mutes in St. Petersburg. He was decorated for his work, ending his career as an official of fairly high rank in the hierarchy of the imperial public service. He was married, with 3 daughters and two sons. He was a person clearly ahead of his times, and expressed disappointment that his “natural method of education" for deaf-mutes found little support among his colleagues, despite its success with patients. He appears to have been equally unsuccessful in persuading participants at the all-Russian 1910 meeting on the education of deaf-mutes in Moscow, of the merits of his method.</p>
<p>While practising medicine in St Petersburg, En'ko continued his researches, and presented a dissertation on revaccination (published in Russian in 1873) for the Doctorate in Medicine of the Medical Faculty of the University of St. Petersburg. This was not accepted, but by accident he found out that Professor Minding of the Tsarist University of Dorpat (now Tartu in Estonia) was interested in probability, and arranged to consult him. Minding understood his approach to the problem and approved his original methods of analysis. In the autumn of 1874, he travelled to the University of Dorpat to take an examination in German, and was then awarded his Doctorate in Medicine by the Medical Faculty for the German version of his dissertation (1874).</p>
<p>Few further details are known about his later life; he continued to practise medicine, and between 1873 and 1913 authored some 71 works, not all of them on strictly scientific topics. Of his many scientific papers, most are in Russian, but some are in German and French. The topics were quite diverse: revaccination, the degeneration of vaccines, muscle contraction, the thorax, the brightness of light, respiratory organs, the artificial feeding of newborn babies, hygiene in daily life, vegetarianism, the teaching of deaf-mutes. His two main works on epidemic problems are his paper on susceptibility to measles and scarlatina (1887), and his famous contribution (1889) on the course of epidemics (see Dietz's English translation, 1989). He died in 1916 during the First World War, just before the Russian Revolution of 1917.</p>
<p>We give a brief description of En'ko's contribution to epidemic modelling. Consider the spread of an infection in a population of size <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ N_t$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img1.png" title="$ N_t$" width="25" /></span> of whom <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ C_t$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img2.png" title="$ C_t$" width="24" /></span> are infectives and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ S_t$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img3.png" title="$ S_t$" width="22" /></span> are susceptibles in discrete time <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ t &gt; 0$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img4.png" title="$ t &gt; 0$" width="46" /></span> . En'ko argued, on the assumption of homogeneous mixing, that a particular susceptible would have a chance</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle P_{C_t} = C_t /(N_t - 1) $" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img5.png" title="$\displaystyle P_{C_t} = C_t /(N_t - 1) $" width="154" /></div>
of making contact with an infective. Thus, if <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ A$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img6.png" title="$ A$" width="19" /></span> is the number of actual contacts of infectives with susceptibles, then the probability of making at least one contact is
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle a_t = 1 - [(N_t - 1 - C_t)/(N_t - 1)]^{A_t}. $" border="0" height="41" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img7.png" title="$\displaystyle a_t = 1 - [(N_t - 1 - C_t)/(N_t - 1)]^{A_t}. $" width="297" /></div>
Hence, assuming that new infectives occur according to the binomial distribution, the total number of new infectives will have a mean <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {a_t}{S_t}$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img8.png" title="$ {a_t}{S_t}$" width="37" /></span> . In En'ko's model, <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ A_t$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img9.png" title="$ A_t$" width="24" /></span> can vary depending on the propensity of individuals to gather in groups, or lead a solitary existence.
<p>En'ko gathered daily data on several measles epidemics at the St Petersburg Alexander Institute and the Educational College for the Daughters of the Nobility, carefully recording the population size <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ N_t$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img10.png" title="$ N_t$" width="25" /></span> and the initial number of cases <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ C_{0}$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img11.png" title="$ C_{0}$" width="26" /></span> . He estimated the number of contacts <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ A_t$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/28/l2h/img12.png" title="$ A_t$" width="24" /></span> , varying the value until he obtained good fits of the data to the theory, and graphing the results. His work foreshadows the Reed-Frost chain binomial model of 1928, and entitles him to be considered as the first epidemic modeller in the modern sense of the word. En'ko's achievement is a vindication of the value of a broad education, resulting in the competent use of mathematical methods by medical doctors; it is also a reminder that original thinking can occur in very unsettled circumstances, such as those prevalent in Russia through much of En'ko's life.</p>

<p><b>Egon Sharpe PEARSON</b><br />
b. 11 August 1885 - d. 12 June 1980<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Egon Pearson continued and developed his father, Karl's, pioneering work in teaching and research in statistics at University College London and, with Neyman, made fundamental contributions to the theory of hypothesis testing.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Egon Sharpe Pearson, the son of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.), was born in Hampstead (London) and died in Midhurst, Sussex. His education took him from Winchester College to Trinity College, Cambridge where he graduated in mathematics. He then moved into his father's department at University College, London in 1921 and remained there, apart from wartime service in the Ministry of Supply, until his retirement in 1960. Advancement was rapid and he was promoted to Reader in 1933, when his father retired, and to Professor in 1935. From 1933 he was also head of one of the two departments into which Karl Pearson's department had been divided on his retirement; R.A. Fisher (q.v.) headed the other.</p>
<p>Like many sons who have followed in the footsteps of famous fathers, it could not have been easy for Egon to establish a distinctive academic identity. Indeed, there was a strong element of continuity between the old regime and the new. He took over the editorship of <i>Biometrika</i> from his father in 1936 and continued in that role until 1966 by which time the journal had been in the hands of the two Pearsons for the whole of the 65 years since its founding.</p>
<p><i>Biometrika</i> has always been a vehicle for the publication of statistical tables, many computed at University College. In the pre-computer era, such tables were the essential infra-structure of practical statistics. They required an immense amount of calculation and Egon Pearson contributed extensively to this enterprise. The Biometrika Trust published many such tables and the most useful were brought together, and widely disseminated, in the two volumes edited jointly with H.O. Hartley: <i>Biometrika Tables for Statisticians</i> Volumes I and II.</p>
<p>Computation was also a key element in the Pearsonian approach to teaching statistics. The many hours spent with Brunsviga calculators left its mark on generations of students. Subsequent developments in computing soon made the skills it imparted obsolete, but first hand experience of handling data was a more durable element.</p>
<p>As a lecturer Egon Pearson was hesitant in delivery but his presentation was liberally illustrated with examples and enlivened with allusions to the historical origins of the methods he described. A particular feature, shared with his father, was the use of geometrical representations to reveal the essential structure of a problem. This was also the subject of his presidential address to the Royal Statistical Society in 1955.</p>
<p>Egon Pearson also shared with his father a deep interest in the history of probability and statistics. In <i>Biometrika</i> there was a long-running series of historical papers leading to a volume of collected papers, edited jointly with M.G. Kendall. Two major memoirs on his father were brought together in <i>Karl Pearson, An Appreciation of his Life and Works</i>, (CUP, 1938) while Egon's last publication, two years before his death, was an edition of his father's lectures on <i>The History of Statistics in the 17th and 18th Centuries</i>.</p>
<p>Egon Pearson's main contribution, however, owed little to the departmental tradition but followed the arrival, in 1925, of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu2" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=77" name="menu2">Jerzy Neyman</a> (q.v.). By that time R.A. Fisher had laid the foundation of estimation theory and significance testing but Neyman and Pearson felt that more account needed to be taken of alternative hypotheses. Over the decade 1928-38 the Neyman-Pearson theory took shape, focusing on the concept of the power of a <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">test</a>. Pearson thought that the germ of this idea had been contained in correspondence with W.S. Gossett (q.v.) but he also remarked once that the concept of power had come to him while looking over a farm gate. Even to those who subscribe to other approaches to inference, this contribution remains one of the landmarks of statistical theory.</p>
<p>The `Neyman-Pearson' theory of hypothesis testing was launched with two <i>Biometrika</i> papers in 1928 running to almost 100 pages. Five years later there followed a major memoir of 48 pages in the <i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</i> and a lesser, but still substantial, paper in the <i>Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society</i>. The tour de force was completed in a three-part contribution, in 1938, to the short-lived <i>Statistical Research Memoirs</i> published by the Statistics Department at University College. These papers are included in the <i>Joint Statistical Papers</i> of J. Neyman and E.S. Pearson published by Cambridge University Press and the University of California Press in 1966.</p>
<p>At the heart of the theory is the Neyman-Pearson lemma. This tells us how to find the most powerful test of a simple null hypothesis against a simple alternative. It shows that, for such a test, the critical region has a boundary on which the likelihood ratio is constant. The desired size of the test is then achieved by an appropriate choice of this constant. If the null and alternative hypotheses are indexed by a single parameter for which a sufficient statistic exists, then the test statistic will be a function of that statistic. If the alternative hypothesis is composite, consisting of a set indexed by some parameter, and if the most powerful test for any member of the family turns out not to depend on which member is chosen, then the same test statistic will serve for all members of the set. In that case we have a uniformly most powerful (UMP) test.</p>
<p>Unfortunately UMP tests seldom exist, and much of the theory is concerned with how to obtain good tests in their absence. This is particularly the case when nuisance parameters are present. Neyman and Pearson introduced such notions as similar regions and unbiasedness to help deal with these cases, but their lasting practical legacy is to be seen in the so-called generalized likelihood ratio test in which unknown parameters are replaced by their maximum likelihood estimators. This includes, as special cases, most of the parametric tests in use today.</p>
<p>These results gave the likelihood function the central place in testing theory, which it already had in Fisher's point estimation theory. It also provided a link with Neyman's later work on interval estimation and, more generally, with Bayesian and likelihood approaches to inference.</p>
<p>A constant theme of the theoretical work of Egon Pearson and his students was the approximation of sampling distributions under both the null and alternative hypotheses. Often this was done within the framework of the Pearson family of frequency curves devised by his father. The common sampling distributions; normal, chi-squared, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/29/l2h/img1.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ F$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/29/l2h/img2.png" title="$ F$" width="19" /></span> , were already members and many more, which could not be determined exactly, could be approximated by a Pearson curve by equating moments. The provision of percentage points for these curves as a function of their skewness and kurtosis provided a solution of the significance testing problem for a very large class of cases.</p>
<p>On the applied side, Egon Pearson made a major contribution to industrial statistics. This seems to have been stimulated by meeting W.H. Shewart (q.v.) and led to the formation by the Royal Statistical Society of its Industrial and Agricultural Research Section in 1933 and, most notably, in a handbook on statistical methods in standardization (BS 600) published in 1935. Wartime service in the Ministry of Supply gave an impetus to this interest which continued through membership of committees of the British Standards Institution.</p>
<p>Egon Pearson's importance in the development of statistics is to be seen, perhaps, not so much in his individual contributions to theory and practice but in the aggregate effect of his many-sided activities focused in the work of the Statistics Department at University College London. Its staff, students and publications had, and continue to have, world-wide influence and, significantly, Egon Pearson's leadership spanned the period when modern statistics was born. His was not the style of leadership exercised in the public arena but in the sustained and meticulous attention to the work of publication, teaching and supervision which underpins the statistical edifice. The regard in which he was held is reflected in the honours which came his way, most notably Fellowship of the Royal Society (1966), President of the Royal Statistical Society (1955-7), its Guy Medal in Gold (1955), and CBE (1946).<br />

<p><b>Agner Krarup ERLANG</b><br />
b. 1 January 1878 - d. 3 February 1929<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Erlang's work provided the methodological framework of queueing theory for application to telephone traffic and was a precursor to much modern theory of stochastic processes.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Agner Erlang was born in Lønberg (near Tarm), Jutland, Denmark. He was descended on his mother's side from the famous Krarup family which had strong academic and ecclesiastical traditions. His father was the village schoolmaster and parish clerk and Erlang was initially educated at his father's school. Later he taught at his father's school for for two years before passing the entrance examination to the University of Copenhagen in 1896 with distinction, and the award of a scholarship.</p>
<p>At the University of Copenhagen, Erlang's studies were in mathematics, with minors in astronomy, physics and chemistry. He attended the mathematics lectures of H.G. Zeuthen and S.G. Juel and these gave him a lifelong interest in geometrical problems.</p>
<p>After graduation with a MA degree in 1901, Erlang taught in various schools for 7 years. He was an excellent teacher, but not a particularly social person. During this time he kept up his studies in mathematics and was a member of the Danish Mathematical Association.</p>
<p>It was through meetings of the Mathematical Association that Erlang made contact with the mathematician J.L.W.V. Jensen (1859-1925) (remembered for Jensen's inequality), then chief engineer at the Copenhagen Telephone Company. Jensen introduced Erlang to F. Johanssen, then managing director of the Company, who had recently introduced probabilistic methods into telephony, and Erlang was recruited in 1908. A new physico-technical laboratory was established with Erlang as its head.</p>
<p>Erlang quickly established a conceptual and methodological framework of queueing theory for application to telephone traffic which can be regarded as a precursor of much modern theory of stochastic processes. In 1909 he published his first major work in which he showed that the number of calls during an arbitrary time interval, assuming calls originate at random, follows a Poisson law, and that the intervals between calls were then exponentially distribured. This simple, but physically realistic formulation has provided the benchmark for the subject.</p>
<p>In 1917 Erlang published his most important paper. For an exchange with <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ R$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/30/l2h/img1.png" title="$ R$" width="19" /></span> channels, a Poisson stream of incoming calls, and exponentially distributed holding times, he calculated the waiting time distribution and the call loss probability. These formulae are now basic in telephone practice. He introduced the concept of “statistical equilibrium", essentially the modern ergodic hypothesis, which allows the interchange of time and space averages. He also introduced the method of “successive stages", now usually called phases, where lifetimes are divided into fictitious stages, the time spent in each having an exponential distribution. In queueing theory the term “Erlang distribution" is typically used for a sum of independent and identically distributed exponential random variables.</p>
<p>Erlang's writing style was brief and elegant and sometimes proofs were omitted. A.E. Vaulot in France and T.C. Fry in the USA, both important contributors to the subject, studied Danish in order to be able to read Erlang's papers in the original language.</p>
<p>A great deal of attention has subsequently been devoted to the extension and modification of the formulae of Erlang, and to the investigation of their validity. Among the earliest major contributors to this were C. Palm and F. Pollaczek (q.v.).</p>
<p>Erlang was concerned with practical procedures as well as with the theory. For example, he systematized the dealing with stray currents which damaged the lead sheaths of telephone cables. Initially he had no laboratory staff to assist him with the measurement of stray currents. “He could be seen frequently in the streets of Copenhagen followed by a workman carrying a ladder, which was used for the purpose of climbing down into manholes" (Brockmeyer, Halstrom and Jensen, p. 17).</p>
<p>An incidental interest of Erlang's was the extinction of family names, as the Krarup family name of his mother was shortly to become extinct. In 1929 he raised the mathematical problem, essentially as it had been earlier and independently posed by F. Galton (q.v.) in 1873, but had been already independently solved by I.J. Bienaymé (q.v.) in 1845. Erlang provided a partial solution which was completed by the Danish actuary J.F. Steffensen in 1930.</p>
<p>Erlang never married and he devoted himself to his work and studies. He was known as a good and charitable man. He worked for the Copenhagen Telephone Company for nearly 20 years, never having time off for illness until he went to hospital just prior to his death.</p>
<p>The “Erlang” has been used in Scandinavian countries to denote the unit of telephone traffic from the beginning of 1944 and general international usage followed in 1946.<br />

<p><b>William FARR</b><br />
b. 30 November 1807 - d. 14 April 1883<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b> Farr is internationally renowned as developer of vital statistics and epidemiology.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>William Farr was born at Kenley, in Shropshire, England, the oldest son in a family of agricultural labourers. His education was fortunately entrusted to Joseph Pryce, a tutor who enrolled him in the local school. There he was taught by a dissident Anglican minister who was a member of the medical, surgical and pharmaceutical guilds. Farr pursued his training in Paris, and later at University College London. In 1832, aged 25, he began to practise as a pharmacist, and published some articles in medical periodicals such as <i>The Lancet,</i> and <i>The British Medical Almanack</i> (which he edited for several years). He also became editor of his own journal, <i>The British Annals of Medicine, Pharmacy, Vital Statistics and General Science</i> with the same publishers as the <i>Almanack</i>, but this journal lasted only for 8 months. It should be noted that in the same year (1837) he contributed to McCulloch's famous book <i>A Statistical Account of the British Empire</i>. Two years later, with Edwin Chadwick's support, he was appointed to the General Register Office (GRO), the new British statistical services unit. The treatment of “vital statistics" in the GRO between 1840 and 1880 may be attributed mainly to him, though he never achieved the enviable position of Registrar General. Despite his position as an essentially anonymous civil servant, Farr was fully familiar with the latest demographic developments of the times, and was able to share his understanding with members of Parliament, and of the Whig Party with which he was connected through Chadwick and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=78" name="menu0">Florence Nightingale</a> (q.v.). His statistical expertise enabled him to verify Dr. John Snow's theory on the propagation of cholera through the London water supply, thus allowing Britain to reduce the effects of this type of epidemic after 1860, when other European countries appeared helpless againt it.</p>
<p>Demography was based on the study of mortality and Farr devoted a large proportion of his works to it (J. and M. Dupaquier, 1985). He saw the dangers of comparisons based simply on the crude mortality rate, because of variations due to age structure and sex differences. He appears to have followed up on the work of the actuary G.P. Neison in the <i>Journal of the Statistical Society of London</i>, 1844 on the methods of “population standard" and “mortality standard". Few improvements remained possible in mortality tables after the writings of the Swede, Pehr Wilhelm Wargentin (1717-1783), who had successfully related the number of deaths by age groups to the corresponding surviving population, and the calculations of life expectancy by the Huygens (q.v.) brothers and A. Deparcieux. Wargentin's method had been extended by the actuaries J. Milne for the city of Carlisle, and T. R. Edmonds for the whole of England. Farr followed up on their studies, successively constructing three mortality tables: the first using the 1841 census and deaths during that year, the second using the same census and deaths in the period 1838-1844, and the third broadening his sources to the 2 censuses of 1841 and 1851, and deaths for the period 1838-1854.</p>
<p>He was thus able to launch a life insurance scheme for all employees of the Post Office, at a time when private companies were using only data based on their customer records. His most original scientific contribution, wrongly attributed to Reed and Merrell, was to give the probability <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (p)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/31/l2h/img1.png" title="$ (p)$" width="29" /></span> on the basis of the mortality rate <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ m$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/31/l2h/img2.png" title="$ m$" width="21" /></span> according to the equation:</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle p = (1-{\frac{1}{2}}m)/(1+{\frac{1}{2}}m)$" border="0" height="58" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/31/l2h/img3.png" title="$\displaystyle p = (1-{\frac{1}{2}}m)/(1+{\frac{1}{2}}m)$" width="202" /></div>
This result may be found in the fifth <i>Annual Report to Parliament</i> of 1843. Another original contribution, which remained unnoticed by both his contemporaries and students was the combination of a fecundity with a mortality table, together with all the necessary calculations for a net reproduction rate (<i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, 1880; see Dupaquier, 1984). However, his objective was limited to finding the total number of children, and he never defined the concept of net reproduction rate. We must therefore continue to acknowledge the Scottish doctor, R.L. Tait and the German statistician, G.F.R. Boeckh, as the true pioneers in this field.
<p>Although he was a doctor trained to respect the ideas of Hippocrates, he nevertheless absorbed the teachings of the French school of clinical anatomy (Broussais, Laennec, Dupuytren, Magendie) and the works of the German chemist Justus von Liebig (1803-1873). Valuing the latter's works too highly, he conceived a “zymotic" theory, in which blood was the carrier of poisons known as zymimes, having an effect similar to fermentation. This led him to believe at first that cholera resulted from a change in the chemical reaction of organic matter, which was transmitted through the air. He was thus led to a law relating the spread of cholera to the elevation of homes above the Thames, a striking example of an error in causal logic (<i>Cholera Report</i> of 1852; see Dupaquier and Lewes, 1989). But the report on cholera in Newcastle-upon-Tyne given by the local Registrar in 1853 showed very clearly the relation between the use of water pumped from the river downstream (after it had passed through the city) and the recurrence of the epidemic. Farr had the courage to admit his own error and the validity of J. Snow's and W. Budd's reasoning, which attributed the spread of cholera to the water supply. He supported the Metropolis Water Act of 1852, which recommended that, within three years, water companies should stop pumping water from the tidal part of the Thames, and he collaborated with Snow to control the spread of cholera in 1854. Through his organisation Farr could provide Snow with the information he required to quickly and unequivocally prove that cholera was spread through water, hence allowing the necessary sanitary measures to be taken.</p>
<p>Soon after Florence Nightingale's return from the Crimea in 1856, she succeeded in having a Royal Commission on the Health of the Army created, with her friend and statistical mentor, Farr, as one of the Royal Commissioners. She intended with his help to make a comparison of the rates of sickness and death in army barracks with rates in civilian life.</p>
<p>After cholera reappeared in 1866, all water was pumped from healthy sources, and Farr gave the English political establishment very convincing arguments for this practice. As an official delegate to the International Statistical Congresses, he proposed a nomenclature for the official cause of death in 1855 but this did not achieve the success he had hoped for. On the other hand, he was heard with great respect when he described the fight against cholera in England at the 1867 Congress. Disappointed by his failure to obtain the job of Registrar General in 1879, his health declined and he died a few year later.<br />

<p><b>Gustav Theodor FECHNER</b><br />
b. 19 April 1801 - d. 18 November 1887<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Physicist, psychologist and philosopher, Fechner is noted for the introduction of quantitative methods into psychology. He also developed a `theory of collectives' which is built on the frequency interpretation of probability.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Gustav Theodor Fechner was born in Gross Särchen near Muskau, Lusatia (Germany), into the family of a protestant minister. He studied medicine, but became disenchanted with the subject and never wanted to practice it. Instead, he devoted himself to experiments in physics in the fashion of the <i>physique expérimentale</i> of the leading French physicists. His translations and revisions of French text books and treatises were the chief channel for the reception of French mathematical science into Germany at this time, and the reform of German physics that resulted from it. His experimental researches, especially in electricity theory, eventually earned him a chair in physics at the University of Leipzig (in Saxony, Germany) where he remained for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Fechner's orientation towards the most advanced physics of his day was supplemented, however, by a strong commitment to idealist and romantic <i>Naturphilosophie</i> which was primarily directed against Cartesian dualism of mind and body and eighteenth-century French materialism. Like other followers of <i>Naturphilosophie</i>, he argued, that nature is animated and that there is an original unity or `identity' of nature and mind which allows us to infer nature's laws from the laws of the mind and vice versa.</p>
<p>In 1839, Fechner had a nervous breakdown as the result of a depressive psychosis. He developed an aversion to food and also to light and experienced temporary blindness and complete prostration. Although he kept the title of a physics professor, he eventually lost his physics chair to Wilhelm Weber and was set on a pension by the university. After his recovery in 1846, he continued lecturing on diverse subjects, especially the mind-body problem, until 1875.</p>
<p>When his crisis was over, Fechner tried to come to terms with the two opposing tendencies of his thought, the strict mechanist mathematical physics on the one side and the romantic <i>Naturphilosophie</i> on the other. As a result of this, he developed a solution to the mind-body problem called `psychophysical parallelism' or `dual aspect theory' which became very popular among scientists in the 19th century. This solution is supposed to be compatible with science as well as with <i>Naturphilosophie</i> and it is central, both to Fechner's subsequent philosophical as well as scientific and mathematical work. According to this view, mind is not to be seen as a substance interacting with the body but as a special attribute of matter on which it is functionally dependent. In the same way as the appearance of an ordinary object, like the back and front of a coin, depends on the perspective of the viewer, so a person, as a body with a mental dimension, can be seen from the outside as well as from the inside. Mind and body are two different aspects of one and the same object. A person appears to outside viewers in another way than to herself or himself. As a consequence, it would not make any sense to say that the mind acts on the body or vice versa as it would be senseless to say that the back of the coin acts on its front when the coin is bent. Rather, if there is a change of a person it can be viewed in a mental as well as in a physical respect. Similarly, the bending of a coin results in a change of the coin's front and of its back at the same time. In thus rejecting causality as an appropriate category for the mind-body relation, Fechner thought he had shown psychophysical parallelism to be compatible with the principle of the conservation of energy. On the basis of his theory, Fechner founded the science of psychophysics, which became the starting point for experimental quantitative psychology.</p>
<p>Before it can be shown what all this has to do with statistics, we have to turn to another philosophical development. One of the most influential and powerful philosophical systems of the first half of the 19th century was that of G. W. F. Hegel. He claimed to have developed a logic which could explain history and nature as the necessary conceptual development of the idea on the way to self-knowledge. One of the most outspoken critics of this system was the Leipzig philosopher Christian Hermann Weisse, Fechner's closest friend. Weisse criticised Hegelian “panlogism" as not giving enough justice to the contingent and individual in nature and history. He argued that concrete reality is not the product of a logically necessary development of ideas as Hegel wanted it; there is something in it that transcends all necessity.</p>
<p>In two addresses of 1849, Fechner tried to show that taking Weisse's idea of indetermination seriously does not preclude the use of mathematics in science. He argued that mathematical descriptions only provide a general frame for natural phenomena not implying any necessity for the individual case, thus being compatible with an indeterminate behaviour on a finer level. He also claimed that in order to admit indeterminate events in nature one does not have to give up the causal law. This law only says that the same effect will recur if the same set of conditions obtains, but it does not preclude the emergence of new conditions in the course of time. This discussion might very well be the first expression of an indeterministic world-view.</p>
<p>The first major application of statistical methods by Fechner, and the first work, where his ideas on psychophysical parallelism and individual indeterminacy come together, are his <i>Elements of Psychophysics</i> of 1860. There, Fechner defined psychophysics as the “exact science of the functional or dependency relations between body and mind, or more general: between the bodily and the spiritual, physical and psychical, world." (Fechner 1860, I, 8) His goal was to measure sensations experimentally and thus to arrive at a quantitative science of psychophysics. The major result of his research was the so-called Weber-Fechner law which says that the intensity of sensation <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ E$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img1.png" title="$ E$" width="20" /></span> increases in proportion to the logarithm of a stimulus <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ R$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img2.png" title="$ R$" width="19" /></span> , or: <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ E = k log R$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img3.png" title="$ E = k log R$" width="94" /></span> .</p>
<p>Fechner conceived of psychophysics as a fundimentally statistical enterprise. The rationale behind his reasoning seems to have been the following: If human beings are free in their actions and if mind and body are correlated in the way as conceived by psychophysical parallelism, then there will be an individual variation in the response of a subject to a physical stimulus. This response will be physical and manifest itself in a certain bodily reaction, but it will also be mental and express itself in a certain judgement. The fluctuations are not to be taken as erroneous deviations from the true value but as the free mode of reaction of the individual to a stimulus.</p>
<p>Among the three methods Fechner developed for measuring sensation is the “method of right and wrong cases". A subject had to lift a pair of weights, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ P$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img4.png" title="$ P$" width="19" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ P + D$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img5.png" title="$ P + D$" width="58" /></span> , and to judge which seemed to be the heavier of the two. After <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img6.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> trials the ratio <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ r / n$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img7.png" title="$ r / n$" width="34" /></span> of right answers to all trials was calculated. Fechner took the “measure of precision" <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ h$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img8.png" title="$ h$" width="16" /></span> that appears in older formulations of the Gaussian law as an expression of the differential sensitivity of the subject, such that <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 2r / n - 1 = {\theta}(h D / 2)$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img9.png" title="$ 2r / n - 1 = {\theta}(h D / 2)$" width="171" /></span> , where <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \theta$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/32/l2h/img10.png" title="$ \theta$" width="14" /></span> is the Gaussian law.</p>
<p>In 1878, Fechner published a paper where he developed the notion of the median. He later delved into experimental aesthetics and thought to determine the shapes and dimensions of aesthetically pleasing objects. He mainly used the sizes of paintings as his data base. In his <i>Vorschule der Aesthetik</i> of 1876 he used the method of extreme ranks for subjective judgements.</p>
<p>Fechner's most important contribution to statistics is his posthumously published book on the measurement of collectives, his <i>Kollektivmasslehre</i> of 1897. Fechner defined a `collective' or `collective object' as a collection of an indefinite number of individual objects, subject to random variation, and embraced under a single specific or generic concept. The main examples he treated are to be found in anthropology, zoology, botany, meteorology, aesthetics. The object of the enquiry is, as Fechner wrote,</p>
<blockquote>“the establishment, by mathematical proof and empirical verification, of a generalisation of Gauss's law of accidental variations, whereby the law is enabled to transcend the limits of symmetrical probability and comparative smallness of the positive and negative deviations from the arithmetical mean, and new relations of uniformity are brought to light." (Fechner 1897, vi)</blockquote>
He developed a set of constants which allowed to characterise different distributions and developed a two-sided asymmetric Gaussian law where the two branches are treated as if originating from two different distributions.
<p>Fechner took the random variation of the collectives quite literally. He spoke of the “ideal laws of chance" which are realised in true collectives. Chance was for him an objective category and not just the expression of ignorance. He tried to design <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a> whereby variation due to factors other than chance could be detected by comparing the data under consideration to a random sequence.</p>
<p>Fechner's <i>Kollektivmasslehre</i> draws on several traditions. There is the moral statistics of the Belgian statistician and astronomer <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=88" name="menu1">Adolphe Quetelet</a> (q.v.) who was one of the first to investigate mass phenomena and to find numerical regularities in them. (Porter 1986) There is also the error theory of the mathematical astronomers Gauss (q.v.), Encke, Bessel and Hauber. And there is the tradition of the statistical bureaux of state administration. Much of Fechner's concept of a collective derives from the Württemberg state official Gustav Rümelin (1815-1889) who had distinguished between particulars that are typical of their genus and individuals that do not allow a straightforward inference as to the nature of the genus as a whole. The latter ones form a collective object and are the subject of statistics as the science of mass phenomena.</p>
<p>Fechner's <i>Kollektivmasslehre</i> was of immediate influence on many of his colleagues in Leipzig. The psychologists Gottlob Friedrich Lipps, Wilhelm Wirth and to some extent also Wilhelm Wundt used the new methods in psychophysics. Charles Edward Spearman who obtained his Ph.D. under Wundt extended Fechner's ideas and studied the correlation between magnitudes. The Leipzig astronomer and mathematician Heinrich Bruns (1848-1919) soon gave a general solution to Fechner's problem of a mathematical representation of frequency distributions, the so-called Bruns-series (today called Gram-Charlier series) and tried to unify Fechner's theory of collectives with probability theory. His most illustrious student was Felix Hausdorff who carried this tradition further. (Girlich 1996) Bruns and Hausdorff, however, dropped Fechner's requirement of chance variation of the collective object, thus obscuring any trace of Fechner's indeterminism.</p>
<p>In <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu2" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=72" name="menu2">Richard von Mises</a>' (q.v.) theory of probability of 1919, however, this condition becomes one of two central requirements. As an axiomatic basis of his theory, von Mises postulated 1. the existence of the limiting values of the relative frequencies and 2. the randomness of the way how the attributes are mapped unto the elements of the collectives. Randomness is thereby defined as the invariance of the frequencies under any place selection - a criterion which clearly shows traces of Fechner's above mentioned test of homogeneity. Von Mises' theory gives a precise formulation of Fechner's basic intuitions. It marks the final defeat of the subjective Laplacean interpretation of probability, consolidates the frequency interpretation and conceives of probability as an empirical science of chance phenomena. One can only speculate what the course of statistics would have been if Fechner's work had been published before K. Pearson (q.v.) developed his biometrics in the early 1890s.<br />

<p><b>Pierre de FERMAT</b><br />
b. 17 August 1601 - d. 12 January 1665<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Arguably the greatest French mathematician of the 17th century, Fermat was instrumental in giving impetus, with Pascal, to the theory of probability.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Fermat, of Basque origin, was born at Beaumont-de-Lomagne, near Montauban in Gascony, the son of Dominique Fermat, second consul of the town, and his wife Françoise de Cazelneuve. His family were leather merchants. He received the elementary part of his schooling, of which little is known, at home and in a local Franciscan school. In 1631 he received his baccalaureate in law from the University of Orléans, having studied, it is thought, in Toulouse and Bordeaux. He worked as a lawyer in the local parliament in Toulouse, becoming Counsellor (<i>Conseilleur de la Chambre des Requêtes du Parlement</i>) in 1634. At about this time he married Louise du Long, and the aristocratic <i>de</i> was prefixed to his family name. Finding time outside of his legal profession, which necessitated maintaining a certain reserve, he became known through his correspondence for his erudition in the humanities and the classics incorporating a profound knowledge of Greek and Latin, a mastery of modern European languages and research in mathematics. He was created King's Counsellor, still in Toulouse, in 1648.</p>
<p>Despite his intellectual brilliance he was reputedly a quiet, friendly and kindly man, whose successful public life was paralleled by a happy family life. His two daughters became nuns. His son, Samuel, a writer, edited his father's work, published as a two-volume <i>Opera mathematica</i> in 1679. Fermat died at the age of 63 (his tombstone says 57), at Castres. There appears to be no definitive biography.</p>
<p>The correspondence between Fermat and Pascal (q.v.), between July and October 1654, which is regarded as laying foundation for the mathematical theory of probability, came about as follows. The unofficial “Academy" which preceded the founding of the Académie des Sciences de Paris in 1665 was that founded by the Abbé Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), indefatigable correspondent on mathematical and scientific matters of his time. Pascal's father, Étienne, had moved to Paris in 1631 to supervise his son's education and became a member of this Academy, which included René Descartes (1596-1650), and whose meetings were initially held at Mersenne's house. Étienne introduced his son to the Academy when <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=81" name="menu0">Blaise Pascal</a> (1623-1662) was fourteen years old. Pierre de Carcavi, who, like Fermat, was Counsellor in the Parliament of Toulouse, was in the correspondence circle of Mersenne, and introduced Fermat into it in 1636, by motivating Étienne Pascal and Roberval to write to Fermat. In regard to what we now know as probability theory, Blaise Pascal's prime concern was the equitable division of stakes, the “problème des partis", or, in English idiom, the “Problem of Points". This is evident from his letter to the Academy entitled <i>Celeberrimae Matheseos Academiae Parisiensis</i>, prior to his correspondence with Fermat, which alludes to work in progress entitled <i>Aleae geometria (The Mathematics of Chance)</i>. Sometime later in that year (1654) in about early July, he wrote to Fermat almost surely about this problem. That letter has not been found, but the first surviving letter, from Fermat to Pascal, is about a simple version of the problem: if a gambler undertakes to throw a six in eight throws, but stops after the first three throws which have been unsuccessful and does not continue, what proportion of the total stake should he have? Pascal's solution is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 125/1296 = (5/6)^3 (1/6)$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img1.png" title="$ 125/1296 = (5/6)^3 (1/6)$" width="197" /></span> , while Fermat's is <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 1/6$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img2.png" title="$ 1/6$" width="33" /></span> . Fermat's would be correct if a total of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ 4$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img3.png" title="$ 4$" width="14" /></span> , rather than <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ 8$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img4.png" title="$ 8$" width="14" /></span> , throws was originally proposed. With 8 the correct proportion (probability) would be <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ 1 - (5/6)^5$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img5.png" title="$ 1 - (5/6)^5$" width="88" /></span> . The second surviving letter, the famous one of 29 July, 1654 from Pascal to Fermat, discusses a more sophisticated version of the problem. In the case of two players at each of a number of trials, each has probability 1/2 of winning the trial. It is agreed that the first player with <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img6.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> wins gains the total stake. The game is interrupted when player A needs <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ a$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img7.png" title="$ a$" width="15" /></span> trial-wins to gain the stake, and player B needs <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ b$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img8.png" title="$ b$" width="13" /></span> . How should the stake be divided? If one considers the maximum number of trials, <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ a + b - 1$" border="0" height="34" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img9.png" title="$ a + b - 1$" width="78" /></span> , that the game may take to reach conclusion, the problem becomes one of “equally likely" outcomes and the calculation of the probability that A wins:</p>
<div align="center" class="mathdisplay"><img align="middle" alt="$\displaystyle \Large {\sum_{r=a}^{a+b-1} {{a+b-1}\choose{r}} {\Bigg / } 2^{a+b-1}}$" border="0" height="77" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/33/l2h/img10.png" title="$\displaystyle \Large {\sum_{r=a}^{a+b-1} {{a+b-1}\choose{r}} {\Bigg / } 2^{a+b-1}}$" width="226" /></div>
is made simple, although in practice the game may end earlier.
<p>The solution by Pascal and Fermat (by different methods) even for some particular cases, was a defining epoch in probability theory.</p>
<p>Fermat's fame in mathematics, however, rests more in the realm of number theory. Fermat's Last Theorem provided a challenge for centuries to both professionals and amateurs.<br />

<p><b>Ronald Aylmer FISHER</b><br />
b. 17 February 1890 - d. 29 July 1962<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> R. A. Fisher transformed the statistics of his day from a modest collection of useful ad hoc techniques into a powerful and systematic body of theoretical concepts and practical methods. This achievement was all the more impressive because at the same time he pursued a dual career as a biologist, laying down, together with Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane, the foundations of modern theoretical population genetics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Ronald Aylmer Fisher, arguably the greatest statistician of this (or any century) was born in Hampstead, England. After attending Harrow, he studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge from 1909 to 1913; later returning to Cambridge first as a Fellow, and then as Professor of Genetics. He died in Adelaide, Australia. Fisher made profound contributions to both theoretical and applied statistics, and to population genetics. His career divides naturally into five periods: 1913 - 1919 (held several minor commercial and teaching positions); 1919 - 1933 (resident statistician at Rothamsted); 1933 - 1943 (Galton Professor of Eugenics, University College, London); 1943 - 1957 (Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics, University of Cambridge); and 1957 - 1962 (retirement). Throughout his life he received many awards and honors, including the Weldon Memorial Medal (1928), election to Fellowship of the Royal Society (1929), and honorary degrees from Harvard University (1936) and the University of Chicago (1956). Fisher's mathematical genius was already evident during his student days at Cambridge. During these years he also gained his first exposure to Mendelian genetics and the English eugenics movement; his interest in statistical inference was intimately connected to these biological interests, and in later years his output was almost always evenly divided between the two areas.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Initial Contributions, 1913 - 1919</b></p>
<p>During his first years after graduation from Cambridge, Fisher published two papers of outstanding significance: one on the small sample distribution of the sample correlation coefficient (1915; CP 4); the other linking the Mendelian and Darwinian approaches to genetics (1918; CP 9). (References to Fisher's papers are to the date of publication and their number in his Collected Papers [=CP] (Bennett, 1971-1974).) During this initial period Fisher was strongly influenced by the work of William Sealy Gossett (“Student") (q.v.), impressing the later by producing a rigorous mathematical derivation for Student's <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img1.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -distribution (in his paper Student had only guessed the form of the distribution on the basis of its first four moments). Encouraged by this first success, Fisher turned to the correlation coefficient. Earlier studies by Pearson (q.v.), Filon, Gosset, and Soper had given approximate, large sample expressions for the mean and standard error of the sample correlation coefficient <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img2.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> . Using geometric insights (representing the outcome of a random sample as a single point in an <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img3.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> - dimensional space, in a mathematical tour-de-force Fisher was able to derive the exact, small-sample distribution of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img4.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> . Although <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> accepted Fisher's paper for publication in his journal <i>Biometrika</i>, two years later a “cooperative study" by Pearson and his associates appeared criticizing Fisher's paper on several grounds. Although relations between Fisher and Pearson remained cordial in the immediate aftermath, Pearson rejected another paper of Fisher submitted to <i>Biometrika</i> and this, together with the rejection of Fisher's Mendelian paper by Royal Society (Pearson had been one of the referees to give a negative report), ultimately led Fisher to a sharp deterioration in relations between the two. Pearson, nevertheless, recognizing Fisher's obvious abilities, offered him a position in his University College London statistical laboratory, but Fisher recognized the incompatibility of their personalities; and when a competing offer came from Rothamsted, an agricultural research station in the English countryside, Fisher readily accepted it.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Rothamsted: 1919 - 1933</b></p>
<p>Fisher's days at Rothamsted were his among his happiest and most productive. Enjoying for the first time a secure position, he was surrounded by appreciative and supportive colleagues, and had access both to important problems and extensive statistical compilations of data that needed analysis. In his element at last, Fisher began to develop an extraordinary range of statistical methods fitted into a theoretical superstructure: during the next fifteen years he produced a flood of papers unparalleled either before or after. These fell into four main categories: statistical <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">tests</a> of significance and distribution theory, contributions to theoretical statistics and estimation theory, fiducial inference, and the design of experiments.</p>
<p><i>a. Statistical tests of significance and distribution theory</i>. Fisher's mathematical skills and geometric insights enabled him to tackle a wide variety of distributional problems, extending the work of Gosset on the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img5.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> - distribution (for whom Fisher had a life-long admiration). One of the most important of these was the distribution of the chi-squared statistic, determining the appropriate number of degrees of freedom if the cell probabilities depended on one or more estimated parameters. Fisher proceeded (in a series of five papers published over the seven year period 1922-1928) to attack Pearson's use of the chi-squared statistic to test homogeneity, on the (entirely correct) grounds that Pearson had systematically employed an incorrect number of degrees of freedom). The result was a heated dispute, to which Fisher repeatedly returned (CP 19, 31, 34, 49, 62, 188). Other, less controversial but equally fundamental distributional results obtained by Fisher during this period included his paper on testing the significance of regression coefficients (1922, CP 20), the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ F$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img6.png" title="$ F$" width="19" /></span> distribution (1924, CP 36), the independence of the sample mean and variance from a normal population (1925, CP 43), the sampling distribution of the multiple correlation coefficient (1928, CP 61)</p>
<p><i>b. The theory of estimation</i>. At the same time as he made major strides in distribution theory, Fisher began to craft a systematic theory of estimation, introducing the basic concepts of sufficiency (192, CP 12), consistency, and efficiency (1922, CP 18; 1925, 42). The method of maximum likelihood was advanced as the practical realization of these three goals; and the entire structure laid out systematically in Fisher's epochal <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i> (1st ed., 1925). The book illustrated Fisher's genius for the apt example, systematic exposition of efficient computational technique, and ruthless suppression of mathematical justification or derivation. The last chapter of the book, involving the estimation of a genetic linkage parameter, is a masterpiece of exposition; using five competing methods of estimation, the advantages and ease of use of the method of maximum likelihood estimation are contrasted with other, less efficient, more eclectic, or more cumbersome modes. Throughout his life Fisher remained an ardent supporter of the method of maximum likelihood, but his views regarding it evolved. His initial 1922 paper argued its large sample merits, but the 1925 paper began to argue that it had small sample advantages as well, and introduced the concept of information loss (as well as the method of scoring).</p>
<p><i>c. Fiducial inference</i>. Pearson was also an exponent of Bayesian methods, and Fisher's rejection of inverse methods and his ultimate development of fiducial inference as an alternative to them was thus yet another assault on the Pearsonian edifice. It is in many ways ironic that Fisher's first paper on fiducial inference, “Inverse Probability" (1930, CP 84), contains little that is controversial. In it Fisher introduced the probability integral transformation, and observed that this transformation often provides a pivotal quantity that can be inverted to obtain interval estimates having any prespecified coverage frequency. It was only later, after Fisher attempted to extend the argument to include multiparameter estimation, that difficulties arose. In 1935 Fisher (CP 125) illustrated the use of a simultaneous fiducial distribution with two examples, one of which was the notorious Behrens-Fisher problem: to estimate the difference in the means <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ m_1$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img7.png" title="$ m_1$" width="29" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ m_2$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img8.png" title="$ m_2$" width="29" /></span> of two normal populations, given that the variances <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {s_1}^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img9.png" title="$ {s_1}^2$" width="29" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ {s_2}^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img10.png" title="$ {s_2}^2$" width="29" /></span> of the two populations are unknown. Few could have predicted then that it would generate a debate lasting several decades. Fisher's solution was almost immediately questioned by Bartlett, who noted that unlike the examples involving the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img11.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -statistic, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient, the interval estimates for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ m_2 - m_1$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img12.png" title="$ m_2 - m_1$" width="76" /></span> advocated by Fisher gave rise to tests with inappropriate levels of significance, in terms of frequencies involving repeated sampling from the same initial population. Unlike Fisher's many other original and important contributions to statistical methodology and theory, fiducial inference never gained widespread acceptance, despite the importance that Fisher himself attached to the idea. Instead, it was the subject of a long, bitter, and acrimonious debate within the statistical community; and although Fisher's impassioned advocacy gave it viability during his own lifetime, it quickly exited the theoretical mainstream after his death. Considerable confusion always existed about the exact nature of the fiducial argument; and the entire subject came to have an air of mystery. Fiducial inference never developed during Fisher's lifetime into a coherent and comprehensive theory, but remained a collection of examples, insights, and goals, added to and modified over time; and the polemical nature of the debate on both sides rendered much of the resulting literature opaque.</p>
<p><i>d. Design of experiments</i>. The abundance of agricultural data available at Rothamsted led Fisher by a direct and natural route to the analysis of variance; and his first paper on this subject appeared as early as 1923 (CP 32). This initial effort suffered from a number of defects: Fisher had not tabulated the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ F$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img13.png" title="$ F$" width="19" /></span> distribution, nor did he yet appreciate fully the crucial role of randomization. But progress came quickly: Fisher's address the next year to the 1924 International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto (CP 36) described the relationship between the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ z$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img14.png" title="$ z$" width="14" /></span> =: 1/2 ln <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ F$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img15.png" title="$ F$" width="19" /></span> , chi-squared, normal, and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/34/l2h/img16.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -distributions; and passages from the 1925 edition of <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i> emphasized the importance of randomization in ensuring the validity of tests of significance. During this period Fisher developed in rapid succession the basic elements of design: blocking, factorial designs (1926, CP 48), Latin squares, confounding, and partial confounding, and the analysis of covariance. This work was summarized in Fisher's classic book <i>The Design of Experiments</i> (1935), another masterpiece of exposition containing the celebrated example of the lady tasting tea (Chapter 2: “The Principles of Experimentation, Illustrated by a Psycho-Physical Example").<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Professor of Eugenics, University College London, 1933 - 1943</b></p>
<p>Ironically, Fisher's move to London and a Professorship marked the beginning of a period of increasing controversy in his life, in particular the dispute with Neyman (q.v.). Before his dispute with Neyman, Fisher had engaged in other statistical controversies, crossing swords with Arthur Eddington, <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu2" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=53" name="menu2">Harold Jeffreys</a> (q.v.), and Karl Pearson. He had been fortunate in his previous choice of opponents: Eddington conceded Fisher's point; Jeffreys was cordial in rebuttal; and Pearson labored under the disadvantage of being wrong. But in Neyman Fisher faced an opponent of an entirely different character. Neyman left Poland at the beginning of 1934 in order to assume a permanent academic position at University College London. Shortly after his arrival in England, Neyman read a paper before the Royal Statistical Society (on 19 June 1934) dealing in part with the fiducial argument, and reformulating Fisher's theory in terms of what Neyman called “confidence intervals". Neyman described introducing his theory of confidence intervals as an alternative description and development of Fisher's theory of fiducial probability, permitting its extension to the several parameter case. Fisher, one of the paper's discussants, in turn referred to Neyman's work as a “generalization" of the fiducial argument, but pointed to the problem of a possible lack of uniqueness in the resulting probability statements if sufficient or ancillary statistics were not employed. Confidence intervals, Fisher thought, make statements which, although mathematically valid, are of only limited inferential value; but that they had some value he conceded in a footnote. In 1935, shortly after this, relations between the two broke down after Fisher's discussion of Neyman's 1935 JRSS paper (read 28 March). Neyman's paper had been critical of some of Fisher's most important work in the design of experiments, although the attack was indirect and towards Fisher himself the tone of the paper was one of almost studied politeness. Fisher's discussion was sharply critical of Neyman, both in substance and tone; and Neyman did not hold back in response. Closely linked to his criticisms of Neyman's confidence intervals were Fisher's emerging views on the nature of conditional inference. There were already hints of this in some of his earlier papers (in particular, CP 42), but the issue first clearly arose in his papers in the 1930s. In his 1934 classic “Two new properties of mathematical likelihood" (CP 108), Fisher introduced the concept of the recovery of information using conditioning; and in his 1934 address to the Royal Statistical Society (CP 108), he turned to the conditional analysis of the two-by-two table and the use of the exact test. In both cases, as throughout his career, the examples advanced beyond the supporting theory, and no general prescription or rationale for conditioning was provided. In his papers of the 1930's, Fisher was just beginning to grapple with these issues, and his comments are at times brief, fragmentary, even tentative. It is symptomatic of the uncertainty he must have felt at this period in his life that in 1941 he made the extraordinary concession that Jeffreys, “whose logical standpoint is very different from my own, may be right in proposing that “Student's' method involves logical reasoning of so novel a type that a new postulate should be introduced to make its deductive basis rigorous" (1941, CP 181, p. 142). But when referring to Neyman, no such concession was possible. By 1945 Fisher's view had hardened, and he labeled the criterion that “the level of significance must be equal to the frequency with which the hypothesis is rejected in repeated sampling of any fixed population allowed by hypothesis" as an “intrusive axiom, which is foreign to the reasoning on which the tests of significance were in fact based" (1945, CP 203, p. 507).<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Professor of Genetics, University of Cambridge: 1943 - 1957</b></p>
<p>Fisher's return to Cambridge, although a professional triumph, was marked by personal tragedy: irreconcilable differences led to permanent separation from his wife, and shortly after, in December 1943, his son George was killed in the war. Fisher's output of scientific papers continued unabated, but although these still contained much of interest, there was nevertheless for the most part a clear decline in their depth and insight relative to his best earlier work, save for the occasional exception, such as “Dispersion on a sphere" (Fisher, 1953; CP 249). His book <i>The Theory of Inbreeding</i> (1949) has been described by his own daughter as “remarkable for being peculiarly his own formulation without reference to, or comparison with, what others had published on that subject" (Box, 1978, p. 417). In the 1950s, sensing that the tide had turned against his theory of fiducial inference, Fisher returned to the subject in his 1956 book, <i>Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference</i> (SMSI, 1956). Fisher's treatment of probability in SMSI revealed an important shift in his view of the nature probability. In his papers before World War II, Fisher had described prior distributions as referring to an objective process by which population parameters were generated; writing for example in 1921, that the problem of finding a posterior distribution “is indeterminate without knowing the statistical mechanism under which different values of [a parameter] come into existence" (1921, CP 14, p. 24), and that “we can know nothing of the probability of hypotheses or hypothetical quantities" (p. 35). In contrast, in the 1950's Fisher espoused a view of probability much closer to the personalist or subjectivistic one: “probability statements do not imply the existence of [the hypothetical] population in the real world. All that they assert is that the exact nature and degree of our uncertainty is just as if we knew [the sample] to have been one chosen at random from such a population" (1959, CP 273, p. 22). None of the populations used to determine probability levels in tests of significance have “objective reality, all being products of the statistician's imagination" (1955, CP 261, p. 71; cf. SMSI, p. 81 ). In the 1st and 2nd editions of SMSI, Fisher referred to “the role of subjective ignorance, as well as that of objective knowledge in a typical probability statement" (p. 33). Thus, although Fisher remained publicly anti- Bayesian, after World War II he was in fact much closer to the “objective Bayesian" position than that of the frequentist Neyman.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Retirement: 1957 - 1962</b></p>
<p>Fisher did not retire from his Professorship of his own accord, but due to an imposed age requirement at Cambridge (although he continued on at Gonville and Caius, elected President of the College in 1957). In his last years, he traveled extensively, visiting Michigan State University in the Fall of 1957, and later both returning to the United States and visiting Japan, India, Belgium, France, and Italy. Controversial to the end, after becoming a scientific consultant for the British Tobacco Manufacturers Standing Committee he repeatedly expressed skepticism both in invited lectures and in print regarding the statistical evidence then available regarding the causal connection between smoking and lung cancer. In 1959 Fisher moved to the University of Adelaide in Australia, spending much of his remaining time there. It was here that he was diagnosed as having cancer in the summer of 1962; and although the operation (on July 21) was judged a success, eight days later Fisher died suddenly of a post-operative embolism.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Literature</b></p>
<p><i>Primary Sources</i>. Fisher's three books on statistical theory (<i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers, The Design of Experiments</i>, and <i>Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference</i>) have gone through many editions. Now individually out of print, they have been reprinted in a single volume by Oxford (Fisher, 1990); <i>The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection</i> (1930) remains in print thanks to Dover Publications. Fisher's Collected Papers (Bennett, 1971 - 1974) remain an invaluable source for the study of Fisher (although the collection omits most of his book reviews, and scattered other minor contributions). Fisher's selected correspondence has also been published in two volumes, one genetic (Bennett, 1983) and one statistical (Bennett, 1990). These are invaluable for understanding the evolution of his thinking, and sometimes contrast in interesting fashion with his more public statements of position. Of particular interest is Fisher's correspondence with Gossett, unfortunately only published privately.</p>
<p><i>Secondary Sources</i>. The biography of Fisher by his daughter (Box, 1978) is an invaluable source of information regarding Fisher's life and personality; its scientific discussion provides a useful orientation for further study. Also useful is the obituary notice of Yates and Mather (1963). There are many appreciations of Fisher's contributions to statistical science; but of particular note is the remarkable effort of L. J. Savage (1976). The essays in R. A. Fisher: An Appreciation (Fienberg and Hinkley, 1980), although of variable quality, have considerable value as assessments of Fisher's contributions from the perspective of later professional statisticians. (Outstanding among these is D. L. Wallace, “The Behrens-Fisher and Creasy-Fieller Problems", pp. 119-147.) Gosset's recent statistical biography (Pearson, 1990) of necessity touches on Fisher throughout. Among the numerous appreciations and discussions of Fisher, two of particular interest are Yates (1951) and Kruskal (1980).<br />

<p><b>Stefano FRANSCINI</b><br />
b. 23 October 1796 - d. 19 July 1857<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Founding father of Swiss official statistics, Franscini was both politician and scientist. He was active in the establishment of Switzerland's national identity and served as Federal Minister of the Interior. He is especially remembered for his advocacy of statistical information as an inherent ingredient of the democratic process.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Profile of a man between agora and science</b></p>
<p>Stefano Franscini was born in 1796 in Bodio, a little village of Ticino, the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland. From childhood he manifested an uncommon intelligence and his parents decided to orient him towards the only educational career accessible at that time to children of modest families: he went to the catholic minor seminary of Pollegio, where he was supposed to be prepared for priesthood. At eighteen he moved to the major seminary of Milan, but finally he decided to abandon theology and turned towards the study of an eclectic variety of authors and fields.</p>
<p>Strongly influenced by liberal thinking, Franscini first took an interest in educational sciences. He worked in Italy as a teacher and his first book (1821) was a school text on Italian grammar which had major success (eigtheen editions in Italy and three in Ticino). Back in Switzerland, he opened and directed, with his wife, two schools inspired by English theories on mutual instruction. He then published a revolutionary pamphlet, <i>Della pubblica istruzione nel Cantone Ticino</i> (1828), in which he denounced the social inequalities and pedagogic lacunas of public schooling, and advocated a radical reform of the educational system.</p>
<p>A man of thought and action, Franscini embarked with equal energy on both scientific and political activity. His first work as a statistician, <i>Statistica della Svizzera</i>, appeared in 1827; then, in parallel with his activities as chancellor and member of the government of the canton Ticino, he published <i>Svizzera Italiana</i> (in German in 1835 and in Italian in 1837) and the <i>Nuova Statistica</i> in 1847. Finally, as a member of the first collegial executive of modern Switzerland, he published the <i>Matériaux pour la statistique de la Conféderation Suisse</i> (1851-1858), which appeared not under his name but attributed to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, of which he was the political head.</p>
<p>Such a statistical work was based on accurate observation of natural, economic and social phenomena. Franscini's portrait of Switzerland was an encyclopedic compendium on geography, topography, climate, fauna, flora, natural resources, demographic structures, agriculture, industrial production, trend, public finances, political institutions, social aggregates and cultural behavior. The amount of information and quality of analysis provided by Franscini appears today particularly impressive if one considers that he worked practically alone, without any assistance or grant. Indeed, in spite of his prominent political role, he never obtained official support for his statistical activity. Thus,</p>
<blockquote>"he had to write himself mountains of letters to cantonal governments, municipalities, enterprises and scientific associations, in order to obtain data on all branches of public activities, education, roads, business, finance, agricultural and industrial production, taxes, prices, salaries... And it was on the basis of such a titanic work that he succeeded to organize and carry out the first federal census in 1850... but always alone, without a statistical bureau, without a single employee." (Calgari, 1968)</blockquote>
In 1855 the government decided for the first time to grant the publication of “federal statistics" with a ridiculous amount of a thousand francs - and it was only in 1860, after Franscini's death, that it decided to create a small Federal Bureau of Statistics.
<p>Franscini not only lacked recognition of his statistical work from his colleagues in government, but he also had to face the arrogant scorn of the Swiss academia of that time. Although his scientific contribution was noticed abroad (he was corresponding member of the French Institute and of the Belgian Central Statistical Society), and he was the inspirer and creator of the federal university (today's Federal Institute of Technology), he experienced humiliating contempt when he applied for a chair of political economy and statistics at this university: the scientific commission simply refused to consider him.</p>
<p>As Franscini spent his entire life serving public interest and the advancement of knowledge, he was forever making a precarious living. His salary as federal minister of the interior was scarcely enough for the needs of a family with ten children and, at the end of his life, he was therefore obsessed by the idea that after his death his family could plunge into extreme poverty. He thus decided to resign his governmental tasks and to accept any position - however modest it might be - which would allow him to secure an income for his family. His political friends proposed him for a post as a director of the Archives of the canton Ticino, but he was not able to benefit from such an “opportunity", as he died in Berne, still a federal councillor, on 19 July 1857. An epitaph on his tomb soberly expresses the integrity of the man and his tragic pain: “<i>Nacque povero, visse povero, mori povero</i>" - “He was born poor, lived poor, died poor".</p>
<p><b>Scientific rigour and democratic process</b></p>
<p>Franscini's scientific and political activities spanned a century quite attuned to the enlightement's ideals and turned towards a positivistic conception of scientific and human progress. The various facets of Franscini's career clearly reflect the spirit of his age. In his work as a statistician and as a politician he always referred to science as a precondition for objective knowledge of economic and social facts - and this evidence was directly linked to his conception of human development and “good government".</p>
<p>Like other scientists of his age, Franscini upheld statistics as an objective basis for knowledge of reality. In schematic terms, one can define his conception of statistical science as “knowledge of facts through rigourous measurement". In this sense, he certainly could share the conception of statistical work defined by Adolphe Quételet (q.v.) in his <i>Instructions populaires sur le calcul des probabilites</i> - which was published the same year as the <i>Statistica della Svizzera</i>. However, Quételet considered that human and social phenomena were to be described and explained through mechanical laws. He believed that the real scientific mission of statistics was to elaborate in the social sphere what Newton accomplished in the celestial sphere. On the other hand, Franscini was not interested in this kind of theoretical development. He considered statistics mainly as an applied science and his work aimed at establishing a comprehensive social science in the modern sense of this term. He attached high interest to statistical methods, but he considered these as means for providing accurate information. Of course, the concept of “statistical information" was unknown to Franscini. Nevertheless, it seems today the most appropriate concept for characterizing the achievement of his work, which aimed explicitly at three main objectives:</p>
<p>i) First of all, Franscini wished to gather together all sorts of relevant information in order to elaborate a unified image of Switzerland as a national entity. Such a task was an enormous challenge, because until the middle of the nineteenth century the Swiss never considered their country as a real national entity; they regarded it mainly as an alliance among cantonal sovereign States. Franscini was conscious that the building of an effective Swiss national entity needed stronger capacity for union based on a real national identity. His statistical work was aimed at building a clear image of Switzerland as a common home land of all Swiss people. He did not simply “describe" the Swiss nation but contributed to building it through the statistical indices on material well-being, on domestic trade, and on prevailing cultural practices" (P. Garonna and F. Sofia, 1996). Undoubtedly, this has been one of Franscini's main achievements: his statistical portrait of the country contributed considerably to the development of a new national awareness.</p>
<p>ii) A second explicit objective of Franscini - as a statistician as well as a politician - was to provide the statistical information required for the management of public affairs of a modern federal State. Thanks to Franscini, it became evident that statistical information was an essential instrument for “good government" and, in the framework of the new institutional order inaugurated by the Swiss Constitution of 1848, statistics were then included in the functions of the federal executive. In his capacity as minister of the interior Franscini thus applied his efforts to laying the foundations of genuine official statistics, focusing on the production of the information needed for the implementation of federal public policies.</p>
<p>iii) Last but not least, the third objective of Franscini's work was to develop statistical information as a tool for education and public knowledge, enabling the population to understand the problems of their country better. Such a pedagogic role of statistical information constitutes one essential component of his conception of official statistics. To Franscini, this was the most challenging mission of official statistics - and this is perharps also one of the most pertinent and modern messages of his intellectual legacy: statistical information should be considered as an inherent ingredient of the democratic process.</p>
<p>The main intentions of Franscini's work are condensed in his last book, <i>Semplici verita ai Ticinesi</i> (“Simple truths explained to people of Ticino", 1854). Here statistics do not appear at the foreground, but throughout they discretely support a didactic argument against simplistic views on public debt and reduction of public expenditures. Franscini sincerely believed that such complex issues could be explained to people on the basis of rigourous information and an appropriate pedagogic approach. He considered this as a mark of both scientific and a civic commitment of the statistician: vis-a-vis demagogic arguments and opportunistic decisions, he had to make public and to explain pertinent simple truths. Franscini's conception of the role of scientists in a democratic society still remains a topical subject because, as he used to say, “<i>la democrazia non è soltanto la maggioranza che vota, è anche la minoranza che pensai</i>" - “democracy is not only the majority which votes, but also the minority which thinks".<br />

<p><b>Maurice FRÉCHET</b><br />
b. 10 September 1878 - d. 4 June 1973<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Fréchet, one of the founders of modern analysis, also made various original contributions to the probability calculus. He played an important role in the organization of a European scientific community in the area of probability and statistics.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>René Maurice Fréchet was born at Maligny in the département of the Yonne, into a Protestant family, which moved to Paris soon after. As a pupil at the Lycée Buffon, M. Fréchet was taught by Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963), before the latter left Paris for Bordeaux in 1894. In 1900, he was admitted to the École Normale Supérieure, the most selective of Parisian Institutions of higher learning. In 1906, he defended one of the most dazzling French theses in mathematics of his time. In it, Fréchet defined the concept of an abstract metric space, and within this framework demonstrated the validity of Weierstrass's theorem. Fréchet's thesis marks the beginnings of analysis on appropriately structured abstract spaces, one of the principal new directions in analysis of this century (Arboleda, 1980; Taylor, 1982-1987). Throughout his life, Fréchet retained his taste for the most general theories and concepts, and some of those which he introduced were real strokes of genius. Sometimes reproached for not having proved truly “difficult theorems", he is often credited only with introducing new concepts, generalizing and resetting problems in a broader new framework within which he could prove “easy theorems" enunciated for his own interest. It is, however, to Fréchet in particular that we owe the first theory of integration with respect to an “abstract measure", in 1915. Kolmogorov was to make use of this to axiomatize probability theory, citing “his master Fréchet" explicitly as his source. Whatever one's views, Fréchet's scientific activity over a period of 60 years was considerable, amounting to over 300 publications covering all areas of pure and applied mathematics, and including about ten important books.</p>
<p>After a period as a schoolteacher at the Besançon (in 1907) and Nantes (in 1908) Lycées, he was appointed lecturer in the Faculty of Sciences at Rennes. Then in 1910, he became Professor in the Faculty of Sciences at Poitiers, replacing Henri Lebesgue, who had been appointed to Paris. Both appointments were due to the direct intervention of Borel (q.v.). After the First World War, during which he served as an Anglo-French interpreter, Fréchet was appointed Professor in the Faculty of Sciences at the newly liberated City of Strasbourg, showcase of French science. Actuarial studies and statistics had been taught at Strasbourg for a long time, within the framework of the German university, associated with names such as Lexis (q.v) and von Bortkiewicz (q.v.). It was here that Fréchet, conscious of his national and international role, and meticulous in the discharge of his duties, began to teach applied mathematics, statistics, actuarial studies, and nomography. His first statistical papers date back to these years. It was entirely to be expected that Fréchet should be called to Paris in 1928, when the Institut Henri Poincaré (IHP) was created, to develop the teaching of probability under the leadership of Borel, its director and the holder of the Chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics at the Sorbonne. It should be noted that Borel held the directorship of the IHP from 1928 until his death in 1956. Apart from Borel, Fréchet was at the time the only French university academic of international renown who was interested in recent developments in probability and statistics. Paul Lévy who had just published a remarkable book on the subject in 1925 (Lévy, 1925) was a Professor at the École Polytechnique and never held a university position.</p>
<p>Fréchet was first appointed lecturer in probability at the Sorbonne's Rockefeller Foundation, and then from the end of 1928 as Professor (without a Chair), was promoted to the tenured Chair of General Mathematics in 1933 and to the Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus in 1935. Finally, at the start of 1941, he succeeded Borel in the Chair of the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics until his retirement in 1949. In 1928 (and at least until 1935) Fréchet was also put in charge of lectures at the École Normale Supérieure. It was in this capacity, with Borel's blessing, that he directed a sizeable number of young mathematicians towards research in probability, in particular Doeblin, Fortet, Loève, Ville, and others.</p>
<p>As soon as he reached Paris in 1928 Fréchet directed his research towards the new “theory of chain events", namely Markov (q.v.) chains. and published the first mathematical synthesis on this topic in 1938. It was also Fréchet who initiated the study of “random elements" taking values in the most general spaces.</p>
<p>In the statistical field, the usual evaluation of his works was not always enthusiastic, to which following severe comment of Harald Cramér <a href="#foot73" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a> attests:</p>
<p>“In early years Fréchet had been an outstanding mathematician, doing pathbreaking work in functional analysis. He had taken up probabilistic work at a fairly advanced age, and I am bound to say that his work in this field did not seem very impressive to me."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Fréchet was the author of several interesting statistical papers, among them one on the one-dimensional Cramér-Rao inequality, some contributions in econometrics, and in spatial statistics.</p>
<p>His statistical researches came from a critical reflection on the theory of errors. In a series of lectures, papers and discussions, particularly with Paul Lévy, between the two World Wars, Fréchet mainly attacked the excessive hegemony of the Gaussian distribution in all areas of application of the theory of errors, and provided alternative solutions. He demonstrated the usefulness of the Laplace probability density, <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (exp - \vert x\vert), -\infty&lt;x&lt;\infty$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/36/l2h/img1.png" title="$ (exp - \vert x\vert), -\infty&lt;x&lt;\infty$" width="215" /></span> , and in connection with it, the use of the median instead of the mean. It was within this framework that he wrote his comments on the <i>l'homme-médian</i>, in contrast, presumably, to Quetelet's (q.v.) <i>l'homme-moyen</i>. He continued his deviationism in 1926, constructing a theory of errors based on an alternative composition of elementary errors: instead of adding them, he proposed taking their maximum. Using an anologue of P. Lévy's argument in his work of 1925, Fréchet proved some fundamental results for the statistics of extreme values, in particular concerning one of the three asymptotic max-stable distributions. He took up the topic of extremes again in 1947, on the occasion of the jubilee of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=72" name="menu0">Richard von Mises</a> (q.v.), another researcher in this area. Meanwhile, he gave his unflagging support to Gumbel's (q.v.) research on extremes, which the latter had begun after his arrival in France in 1932/33.</p>
<p>Other foci of Fréchet's interest in statistics were closely tied to Gumbel, as their rich correspondence indicates: the concentration of incomes, the correlation coefficient, contingency tables with fixed marginals, etc. (Hertz, 1997).</p>
<p>A recently rediscovered insight was what has been named Fréchet Optimality in the theory of probability inequalities (Seneta and Chen, 1996)</p>
<p>Fréchet was a member of the International Statistical Institute from 1931, Honorary Life Member from 1959, and Vice President from 1960. It was he who chaired the first four international conferences devoted entirely to probability and its applications in Geneva (1937), Lyon (1948), Paris (1949), Amsterdam (1954).</p>
<p>For about 30 years, from the mid 1920's to the end of the 1950's, Fréchet acted as an intermediary for communicating information in probability and statistics, as his varied correspondence with scholars in many countries, preserved in the Archives of the Academy of Sciences, attests. In particular, this repository contains some of the rare surviving letters of Paul Lévy before the Second World War. An open individual, Fréchet worked after the Second World War for the integration of scholars from the Soviet block into the International Statistical Institute, for the peaceful union of peoples, and the spread of Esperanto as a universal language. Some of his works, particularly in Japan, were published in Esperanto.</p>
<p>Fréchet was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the Institut de France in 1956, occupying the seat left vacant by Émile Borel's death.<br />

<p><b>Carl Friedrich GAUSS</b><br />
b. 30 April 1777 - d. 23 February 1855<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Gauss shaped the treatment of observations into a practical tool. Various principles which he advocated became an integral part of statistics and his theory of errors remained a major focus of probability theory up to the 1930s.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Gauss was born on 30 April, 1777 in Brunswick, Germany, into a humble family and attended a squalid school. At the age of ten, he became friendly with Martin Bartels, later a teacher of Lobachevsky. Bartels, an assistant schoolmaster in Gauss's school, studied mathematics together with Gauss and introduced him to influential friends. From 1792 to 1806 Gauss was financially supported by the Duke of Brunswick. He was thus able to graduate from college (1796) and Göttingen University (1798). He then returned to Brunswick and earned his doctorate from Helmstedt University (1799). Only in 1807 did Gauss become director of the Göttingen astronomical observatory (completed in 1816), and his further life was invariably connected with that observatory (and the university of the same city). Gauss was twice married and had several children, but none became scientists. He died in Göttingen on 23 February, 1855.</p>
<p>Gauss is regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He deeply influenced the development of many branches of mathematics (e.g., algebra, differential geometry) and initiated the theory of numbers; he was an illustrious astronomer and geodesist, and together with Weber he essentially contributed to the study of terrestrial magnetism. Gauss's importance for developing the mathematical foundation for the theory of relativity was “overwhelming" (Einstein, quoted by Dunnington on p.349 without an exact reference). His command of ancient languages was exceptional, and, until he discovered the possibility of constructing a regular 17-gon with a straightedge and compasses, he had remained undecided whether to pursue mathematics or philology. He also possessed an admirable style in his mother tongue.</p>
<p>Gauss was vey slow in making known his findings, many of which were published posthumously. He kept silent about his studies of the “anti-Euclidean" geometry, as he called it, although he (successfully) nominated Lobachevsky for Corresponding Membership of the Göttingen Royal Scientific Society. He was showered with honours from leading academies. In 1849, he became honorary citizen of Brunswick and Göttingen. He had no peers in science and remained isolated, partly because of his own disposition. He was reluctant to refer to other authors and did not befriend younger scholars (e.g., Jacobi, Dirichlet). Gauss attached great importance to such problems as the relation of man to God, but thought that they were insoluble. He believed in enlightened monarchy; however, in a letter, he wrote about the golden age to be expected in Hungary after the 1848 revolution.</p>
<p>As an astronomer, Gauss is best known for determining the orbits of the first minor planets from a scarce number of their observations and calculating their perturbations, and for contributing to practical astronomy. He and Bessel independently originated a new stage in experimental science by introducing thorough examination of instruments. Gauss also detected the main systematic errors of angle measurements in geodesy and outlined means for eliminating their influence. For about eight years he directly participated in triangulating Hannover. After 1828, he continued to supervise the work, which ended in 1844, and he alone performed all the calculations. His celebrated investigation of curved surfaces and study of conformal mapping were inspired by geodesy.</p>
<p>Gauss solved several interesting probability-theoretic problems. In 1841, Weber described Gauss's opinion that, in its applications, probability should be supplemented by “other knowledge" and that the theory offers clues for life insurance and for determining the necessary numbers of jurors and witnesses. Gauss also studied the laws of infant mortality and for several years directed the widows' fund at Göttingen University.</p>
<p>The treatment of observations occupied Gauss at least from 1794 or 1795. He decided that redundant systems of physically independent linear equations should be solved according to the principle of least squares. He applied it in his astronomical and geodetic work and recommended it to his friends. In 1809 he published its justification. Issuing from a postulate that the arithmetic mean of direct measurements of a constant should be assumed as its value, and making use of the principle of maximum likelihood, he arrived at the normal distribution of observational errors as their only possible even and unimodal law. He also supposed a uniform prior distribution of errors; this, hovever, was already implied by his postulate. He substantiated maximum likelihood by the principle of inverse probability. Gauss claimed to be the inventor of least squares although Legendre (q.v.) had introduced it publicly (without justification) in 1805. For him, priority always meant being first to discover.</p>
<p>In 1823 (supplemented in 1828) Gauss put foward a new substantiation of least squares pointing out that an integral measure of loss (and, more definitely, the principle of minimum variance) was preferable to maximum likelihood, and abandoning both his postulate and the uniqueness of the law of error. (The normal law still holds, more or less, on the strength of the central limit theorem. In 1888, Bertrand (q.v.) nastily remarked that for small values of <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \vert x\vert$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img1.png" title="$ \vert x\vert$" width="26" /></span> any even law <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ f(x) = a^2 - b^2 x^2\approx\alpha^2\exp (-\beta^2 x^2)$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img2.png" title="$ f(x) = a^2 - b^2 x^2\approx\alpha^2\exp (-\beta^2 x^2)$" width="284" /></span> .) Also in 1823, Gauss offered, for unimodal distributions, an inequality of the Bienaymé - Chebyshev type, and another one, for the fourth moment of errors, as well as the distribution-free formula for the empirical variance, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ m^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img3.png" title="$ m^2$" width="29" /></span> , and for its own variance, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Dm^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img4.png" title="$ Dm^2$" width="45" /></span> . Owing to an elementary error, his <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ Dm^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img5.png" title="$ Dm^2$" width="45" /></span> was wrong; first Helmert (1904), then Kolmogorov et al (1947) corrected it. Gauss set high store by the formula for <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ m^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img6.png" title="$ m^2$" width="29" /></span> which provided an unbiased estimate of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \sigma^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img7.png" title="$ \sigma^2$" width="24" /></span> ; however, in geodetic practice precision is characterized by its biased estimator, <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ m$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img8.png" title="$ m$" width="21" /></span> , and Helmert thought that only relative unbiasedness was important.</p>
<p>Gauss also estimated the precision of the estimators of the unknowns of his initial linear system, and of linear functions of these. Partly owing to his apt notation, his method of solving normal equations by eliminating the unknowns one by one became standard. He also applied iterative processes (as described by Dedekind), and he introduced recursive least squares which mathematicians did not notice until recently. In 1816, he proved that, for normally distributed errors <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ e_i$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img9.png" title="$ e_i$" width="19" /></span> , the measure of precision <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ h = 1/\sqrt{2\sigma}$" border="0" height="42" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img10.png" title="$ h = 1/\sqrt{2\sigma}$" width="96" /></span> was best estimated by <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \ldots + e_n^2)$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img11.png" title="$ (e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \ldots + e_n^2)$" width="160" /></span> , rather than by <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ (\vert e_1\vert^{k} + \vert e_2\vert^{k} + \ldots + \vert e_n\vert^{k})$" border="0" height="39" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img12.png" title="$ (\vert e_1\vert^{k} + \vert e_2\vert^{k} + \ldots + \vert e_n\vert^{k})$" width="217" /></span> , for any other integer <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ k$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/39/l2h/img13.png" title="$ k$" width="15" /></span> .</p>
<p>Gauss's contribution to the treatment of observations somewhat extended by Helmert defined the state of the classical theory of errors. It seemed perfect, and geodesists hardly paid attention to statistics, whereas statisticians hardly studied Gauss and thus missed the opportunity to develop analysis of variance and regression with less effort. This situation did not begin changing until well into the 20th Century.<br />

<p><b>Gertrude Mary COX</b><br />
b. 13 January 1900 - d. 17 October 1978<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Gertrude Cox is principally known as a gifted statistical administrator and entreprenaur, as well as for her contributions to psychological statistics and experimental design.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Gertrude Cox was born on a farm near Dayton, Iowa, USA. The family soon moved to the small town of Perry, Iowa, where she attended public school. Cox was particularly close to her mother, Emma, and later wrote of her: “I learned from my mother the value and joy of doing for other people. She nursed the sick for miles around and raised us to be active church workers”.</p>
<p>Gertrude Cox's ambition was to help others. She took a two-year course in social science, then spent another two years as a housemother for sixteen small orphan boys in Montana. As preparation for becoming the superintendent of the orphanage, she decided to enroll at Iowa State College. Majoring in mathematics, because it was easy for her, she elected courses in psychology, sociology, and crafts - courses useful to her in her chosen career. In 1929 she received her B.S degree.</p>
<p>To help pay her college expenses Cox did computing. George Snedecor (q.v.) - her calculus professor - having asked her to work with the comptometers in his computing laboratory. Perhaps because of this computing experience, Cox became interested in statistics. But the Mathematics Department at that time would not award an assistantship to a woman, and she financed her graduate work with assistantships in psychology and art. In 1931, she received the first Master's degree ever given by Iowa State in statistics but was turned down for a job teaching high school mathematics because she did not have the required courses in education. She decided to continue her graduate career.</p>
<p>Because of her love of people and her desire to learn what “made them tick”, Cox chose psychology as her research area. With a graduate assistantship at the University of California, Berkeley, she began work on a doctorate in psychological statistics. But she stayed only two years. In 1933, Iowa State established its Statistical Laboratory under the direction of George Snedecor, Cox's former mentor, and he persuaded her to return home to help him. Back in Iowa, she continued her interest in psychology and worked on the evaluation of aptitude <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a>, test scoring procedures, and the analysis of psychological data.</p>
<p>At the same time, she was put in charge of establishing a Computing Laboratory and consulted in and taught experimental designs. In 1934 she began to teach `Design of Experiments' - a course that would become renowned - to follow Snedecor's `Statistical Methods'. Both courses were originally taught from mimeographed materials. In 1937, Snedecor's material came out in book form, but Cox only published her design material in 1950, when it came out as a collaborative effort with W.G. Cochran.</p>
<p>Gertrude Cox's course was built around a multitude of specific examples in a variety of areas of experimentation. Both as a teacher and as a consultant she particularly emphasized randomization, replication and experimental controls as procedures essential to experimental design.</p>
<p>Though Gertrude Cox was enrolled in a PhD program in mathematics at Iowa State, her teaching and consulting duties did not leave her enough time to write a dissertation. An `assistant' from 1933, she was appointed research assistant professor in 1939, though her design course was listed under Professor Snedecor's name.</p>
<p>In 1940 Snedecor was asked to recommend candidates to head the new Department of Experimental Statistics in the School of Agriculture at North Carolina State College. “Why didn't you put my name on the list?” Cox asked when he showed her his all-male list of candidates, and her name was added to the accompanying letter in the following postscript: “If you would consider a woman for this position, I would recommend Gertrude Cox of my staff.” This terse note was to have far-reaching consequences for statistics, for not only was Cox considered, she was selected.</p>
<p>Gertrude Cox became the head of North Carolina State's Department of Experimental Statistics on November 1, 1940. She recruited capable applied statisticians to teach basic statistical methods and she made them available to consult with researchers on procedures for designing experiments and analysing data. To secure at least one faculty member for every agricultural discipline, she had to start from scratch. “There weren't any statisticians to hire when I first started”, she later wrote. “I had to choose from other fields and train them.”</p>
<p>Another innovative feature of the Cox statistics program was a series of one-week working conferences on specific topics. In addition to experimental and mathematical statistics, these conferences covered many research areas involving statistics. Many were held during World War II. Cox, realizing the importance of quality control methods to the war effort, included engineering statisticians on the faculty.</p>
<p>Gertrude Cox was uniquely able to secure outside financial support. In 1944 she obtained a grant from the General Education Board to establish and direct an Institute of Statistics. This grant enabled her to add six faculty members to her department, including W.G. Cochran, who was to develop a graduate program. In 1945, the General Education Board made an additional grant to establish a Consolidated University of North Carolina Institute of Statistics, with a Department of Mathematical Statistics at Chapel Hill, to concentrate on graduate training and research in statistical theory. With complimentary graduate programs, the two departments produced many outstanding applied and theoretical statisticians. Cox also persuaded the Rockefeller Foundation to support a substantial program in statistical genetics and she obtained funds from the Ford Foundation for a joint program in dynamic economics with the London School of Economics.</p>
<p>Cox's first contact with statistics came in the computing laboratory, and she remained a strong advocate of the integral connection between statistical analysis and an up-to-date computing facility. She made certain that the Institute was in the forefront when it came to statistical software, and Raleigh statisticians designed the initial SAS programs.</p>
<p>Gertrude Cox and seven other members of the North Carolina State statistics faculty arranged for a Statistical Division as part of in the proposed not-for-profit Research Triangle Institute (RTI) between Raleigh and Chapel Hill. RTI was established in 1959 and Cox retired from North Carolina State in 1960 to direct its Statistics Research Division. During her five-year tenure, RTI - and especially the Statistics Division - became an internationally recognized consulting and research organization.</p>
<p>Gertrude Cox's major contribution to science was her ability to organize and administer programs, but her early accomplishments in psychological statistics and experimental design were widely recognized.</p>
<p>Cox was a founding member of the International Biometric Society in 1947, served as editor of its journal, <i>Biometrics</i>, from 1947 to 1955, and was president from 1968 to 1969. She was president of the American Statistical Association (ASA) in 1956.</p>
<p>In 1959 Cox received the highest recognition the Consolidated University of North Carolina can confer upon its faculty - the O. Max Gardner Award. The citation named her a `statistical frontierswoman'. In 1970, North Carolina State honored her by designating the building in which the Statistics Department is located Cox Hall. Her most treasured honor came in 1975, when she was elected to the National Academy of Science.</p>
<p>Cox was a world traveller who particularly enjoyed working in developing countries wherr she could offer advice and inspiration. Egypt and Thailand were particular favourites.</p>
<p>Gertrude Cox loved people, especially children. She always brought back gifts from her travels and was especially generous at Christmas time. She considered the faculty members and their families to be her family and entertained them frequently.</p>
<p>In 1976, Cox learned that she had leukemia but remained sure that she could conquer it up to the end. While under treatment at Duke University Hospital she kept detailed records of her progress. With characteristic testy humor she called herself “the experimental unit”, and died as she had lived, fighting to the end.<br />

<p><b>Robert Charles GEARY</b><br />
b. 11 April 1896 - d. 8 February 1983<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Geary contributed to areas of statistical theory, including normality <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu0">tests</a>, stochastic ratios and time series analysis, whilst working in Dublin as an official statistician and writing influentially on topics in that field, such as national income accounting and price deflation.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Robert (Roy) Charles Geary was born in Dublin, Ireland, the eldest child in a family of two sons and two daughters. His father was a statistician in the General Registrar's Office in Dublin and an enthusiast for statistics. Roy's childhood was a happy one. He proceeded to University College, Dublin in 1913 to study mathematics. He gained all possible prizes and honours as a student and won a Travelling Studentship to the Sorbonne in 1919. He studied mathematics there for two years under Lebesgue, Goursat, Borel, Cartan and Langevin and with Hadamard at the College de France. He returned to Dublin in 1921 where he gained some teaching experience and continued to study and research in mathematics.</p>
<p>This was the time of the Anglo-Irish War which was to lead to the foundation of the Irish State in 1922. Roy wished to contribute to the fledgling state and so, at the beginning of 1923, he turned down the offer of a university position in Southampton in favour of a post as Statistician in the Statistics Branch of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Dublin. He was to remain a government statistician until 1957, becoming Director of the newly estalished Irish Central Statistics office in 1949. He spent 1957-1960 in New York as Chief of the National Accounts Branch, Statistical Office, United Nations and then returned to Ireland to head the newly established Economic research Institute (ERI) in Dublin (see Kennedy, 1993). He remained with the Institute (later to become the Economics and Social Research Institute) for the rest of his life - as Director until 1966 and as Consultant thereafter until his sudden death.</p>
<p>Roy thus began work in 1923 publishing his first paper in 1925. Statistics was then in the midst of a great formative period to be dominated by Fisher (q.v.) who by 1925 had published his <i>Statistical Methods for Research Workers</i> and who was to be the abiding influence on Roy. But the immediate task in Ireland was the building up of the National Statistical Service and Roy, while initially junior, of course, was to be the key figure in this.</p>
<p>Over his subsequent civil service career, he played the major role in many aspects of national statistics including the provision of greatly varied data. He provided at different times several sets of detailed population projections, a matter of great national importance, thereby debunking alarmist views, widely held in the 1940's and early 1950's, that Ireland's unusual demographic characteristics and high emigration propensity would lead to great shrinkage of population. He played the major role in the development of Ireland's national accounts and in many other statistics including various price and quantity index numbers. He also played an important role in official statistics at the international level, being one of the founding members of the Conference of European Statisticians.</p>
<p>Despite his arduous duties in the government statistical service, Roy was a prolific publisher in academic journals. This continued while he directed the E(S)RI, and indeed, to his death. Of his some 120 publications, more than half were written after his sixty-fifth birthday. Most are theoretical, and of these the most important were written between 1930 and 1956.</p>
<p>In a series of articles describing different elements of his life and work, Spencer (1976, 1983, 1993, 1997), I have separated his work into different streams. Apart from his work as government statistician (see Linehan, 1997), he wrote extensively and influentially on (a) ratios of random variables, (b) testing for normality and robustness, (c) estimating relationships between variables, where the variables are measured with error. A flavour of some of this work follows.</p>
<p>In <i>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society (JRSS)</i> 1930, he considered the ratio of two correlated normal variates and, under the assumption that the denominator was unlikely to be negative, established the density of the ratio. In <i>Biometrika</i> 1944, he generalised a 1937 theorem of Cramér on the distribution of the ratio of independent variates where the denominator is non-negative with finite man to the case of dependence.</p>
<p>In <i>Biometrika</i> 1935, 1947, he suggested the ratio of the mean deviation to the standard deviation (the Geary Ratio) as a test for normality. In 1938 he published with his colleague E.S. Pearson, a <i>Biometrika</i> brochure, "Tests for Normality". In <i>JRSS</i> 1936 and in his 1947 <i>Biometrika</i> paper, he considered the robustness of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/41/l2h/img1.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ F$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/41/l2h/img2.png" title="$ F$" width="19" /></span> tests in situations where the underlying distributions were not normal, showing, for example, that with <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/41/l2h/img3.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> tests the main trouble arises with asymmetric parent populations. Thus, positive skewness of the parent population would lead to left tail rejection of the null hypothesis too often.</p>
<p>His early work on estimation was based heavily on cumulant theory and is much less cited than his famous 1949 <i>Econometrica</i> paper which has been described as the definitive paper on instrumental variable estimation for the errors in variables model and which has led to Geary being described, with Reiersol, as the founder of the Instrumental Variables method of estimation of relationships.</p>
<p>He showed in his 1936 <i>JRSS</i> paper on robustness that independence of mean and variance imply normality, not just the well known reverse. In a 1942 <i>JRSS</i> paper he showed that maximum likelihood minimises that generalised variance and in a 1944 <i>Biometrika</i> paper, he established some relationship between Pitman's (q.v.) closeness and efficiency. In 1954 <i>Incorporated Statistician</i>, he introduced his contiguity ratio, a statistic designed to measure whether the data for adjoining spatial regions are more similar than for regions not adjoining. This is perhaps his most cited paper - cited not only in geography, but, in fields as diverse as agriculture, archaeology, biology, ecology, epidemiology, genealogy, genetics, human and veterinary medicine, sociology.</p>
<p>In almost all of his work, Roy's life in practical statistics is evident. How to forecast, how to estimate relationships, how to test hypotheses when data is poorly measured and when underlying assumptions are not strictly valid? These are for him the questions, with theory to be judged by how well it performs in practice and with mathematical statistics having its raison d'etre always in application.</p>
<p>This emphasis on application, while influenced no doubt by his life as a working government statistician, stemmed from his highly developed social conscience. This conscience was there from the beginning, exemplified perhaps by his decision to help with the practical side of things at the formative state of the new Irish State, but it probably increased as time passed. He saw the existence of a government statistical service as of enormous value in the stabilising of public opinion. Good data, he believed, had a vital role in narrowing the differences between parties. He constantly, as a civil servant, sought to improve the relevance, timeliness and accuracy of the official data and welcomed queries and indeed vists from outsiders. He believed that an independent statistics office was one of the principle guarantees of civil liberties and was proud to say that in his experience, the independence of Irish statistics had never seriously been challenged by the politicians.</p>
<p>He tirelessly advocated the necessity of quantification in research and was strongly critical of theory without measurement in the social sciences. He was particularly critical of economics, perhaps because he knew it best of the social sciences - indeed, he contributed to it, for example, in regard to international comparisons of real income (Neary, 1997) - and perhaps because he thought it had, in principle, a lot to offer.</p>
<p>As a government statistician, much of his applied work must have been unpublished. he did, however, publish a great deal of applied work including applications as example in his theory papers. Thus, his 1930 <i>JRSS</i> paper on ratios contained an application to Irish data on mortality from tuberculosis, a topic in which he had a continuing interest. When he took over the Directorship of the new ERI in 1960, his owrk became more obviously applied in response to the need for relevant policy advice. For the remaining twenty-three years of his life, he increasingly turned to applied economics and social science. His personal prestige was crucial in the establishment of the Institute and its reputation as a reliable source of independent policy advice.</p>
<p>Roy received many honours in his life including Honorary Fellowships of the Royal Statistical Society and American Statistical Association. He was Acting President of the International Statistical Institute in 1957, was an influential Chairman of Council of the International Association for Research in Income and Wealth, 1961-1967 and was a Member of council, Econometric Society, 1962-1964. With all his success, he remained a man of great courtesy and charm and with a strong sense of humour. He had wide life-long interests, including his family, classical music, the theatre, sport, especially soccer, and politics. He abhorred conflict, whether labour-management conflict or physical violence, perhaps especially that in Ireland. His greatest legacy must lie in his mathematical statistics, the great bulk of which exemplifies the practical importance of good theory. But his contribution to the orderly development of Irish society through his work as government statistician and producer and analyst of data was also significant, though to an extent that is harder to measure.<br />

<p><b>William Sealy GOSSET</b><br />
b. 13 June 1876 - d. 16 October 1937<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Better known by his pseudonym, `Student', Gosset's name is associated with the discovery of the <em>t</em>-distribution and its use, and he had a profound effect on the practice of statistics in industry and agriculture.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>William Sealy Gosset was born in Canterbury, England. He received a degree from Oxford University in Chemistry and went to work as a “brewer” in 1899 at Arthur Guinness Son and Co. Ltd. in Dublin, Ireland. He died in Beaconsfield, England at the age of 61, still in the employ of Guinness.</p>
<p>By the circumstances of his work, Gosset was led early in his career at Guinness to examine the relationship between the raw materials for beer and the finished product, and this activity naturally led him to learn the tools of statistical analysis. In 1905, Gosset sought out the advice of <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.) and subsequently spent the better part of a year, in 1906-1907, in Pearson's Biometric Laboratory at University College London, where he worked on small sample statistics problems. Gosset then produced a pair of papers that were published in <em>Biometrika</em> in 1908, under the nom de plume, `Student.' The first of these derived what we now know as `Student's' <em>t</em>-distribution, and the second dealt with the small sample distribution of Pearson's correlation coefficient. These contributions placed Gosset among the great men of the newly emerging field of statistical methodology. In fact, the <em>t</em>-<a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu1">test</a> based on his 1908 paper is perhaps the single most widely used statistical tool in applications.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Gosset worked on a variety of statistical problems in agriculture, including experiments. He was in active correspondence with the leading English statisticians of his day, including Karl Pearson, Egon Pearson (q.v.), and R. A. Fisher (q.v.). Gosset's correspondence with Fisher dealt with highly varied topics and was, as Plackett and Barnard note, “interspersed with friendly advice on both sides.” In his later years, he had a number of public disagreements with Fisher over the role of randomisation in experimentation. Gosset was a strong advocate of experimental control, a point that came through quite vividly in his proposal in connection with the Lanarkshire milk experiment in `Student' (1931), although in this paper he was also critical of an evaluation of the study carried out by Bartlett and Fisher (1931). In particular, Gosset was enamoured by the use of systematic experimental plans and opposed the use of randomisation. This controversy led Gosset to prepare his final paper (`Student,' 1937) published a few months after his death.</p>
<p>In the next section, we comment on some of the technical details of Gosset's seminal 1908 contributions. For further details on Gosset's life and contributions, see Plackett and Barnard (1990). Gosset's writings are collected in `Student' (1942).<br />

<p><b>Gosset on the Mean and the Correlation Coefficient</b><br />
<i>Small Sample Theory of the Mean</i></p>
<p>In 1908, Gosset's work at the Guinness brewery led him to publish the results that would become associated with his name in future generations. In an article entitled “The probable error of a mean” (`Student', 1908a), he established the sampling distributions of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ s^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img1.png" title="$ s^2$" width="21" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ s$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img2.png" title="$ s$" width="14" /></span> for an independent and identically distributed sample of size <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img3.png" title="$ n$" width="16" /></span> from a normal population. He then showed that the mean and the standard deviation of such a sample are uncorrelated and derived what we now know as `Student's' <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img4.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -distribution.</p>
<p>At time of publication, the importance of these results was not fully recognised. The focus among most contemporary statisticians was on large-sample theory and Gosset's emphasis on small samples, arising from his work at the brewery, set him somewhat apart. In fact, it was not until Fisher generalised `Student's' <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img5.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -distribution that it came into widespread use outside of the Guinness brewery itself.</p>
<p>Aside from the derivations mentioned above, there are a number of interesting features of the 1908 manuscript. First is the break from the tradition of the Biometric School, which used the same symbol for both the population parameter and the sample statistic. In Gosset's paper, he uses <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ s^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img6.png" title="$ s^2$" width="21" /></span> for the sample variance and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \sigma^2$" border="0" height="19" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img7.png" title="$ \sigma^2$" width="24" /></span> for the population variance. Work with large samples had obscured the need for this distinction, which became clearer when the focus was shifted to small samples (Pearson, 1939).</p>
<p>Another aspect of this paper worthy of note is Gosset's use of a sampling experiment to help empirically solve the problem at hand, instead of finding an analytic solution. The essence of the simulation was the following - using data on the height and left middle finger measurements of 3000 criminals, he generated 750 random samples of size 4. Gosset then calculated the means, standard deviations and correlation coefficient of each sample as well as <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img8.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -statistics. He plotted the empirical distributions of the latter and compared them to the theoretical ones he had derived. Using <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \chi^2$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img9.png" title="$ \chi^2$" width="24" /></span> tests for goodness of fit, he deemed the results to be satisfactory. In connection with this empirical study, Gosset noted that “...if the distribution is approximately normal our theory gives us a satisfactory measure of the certainty to be derived from a small sample...” ( `Student', 1908a, p. 19). Furthermore, “[i]f the distribution is not normal, the mean and the standard deviation of a sample will be positively correlated, so that although both will have greater variability, yet they will tend to counteract each other, a mean deviating largely from the general mean tending to be divided by a larger standard deviation. Consequently, I believe that the table given... below may be used in estimating the degree of certainty arrived at by the mean of a few experiments, in the case of most laboratory or biological work where the distributions are as a rule... sufficiently nearly normal” (ibid). Gosset's intuition that the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img10.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -test would be robust against small departures from normality, while not proven here, would later be verified (Pearson, 1929; Geary (q.v.), 1936, 1947).</p>
<p>This paper implicitly takes an inverse probability approach, although there is no discussion of prior distributions. We encounter, for instance, statements such as “Thus, to take the tables for samples of 6, the probability of the mean of the population lying between <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ -\infty$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img11.png" title="$ -\infty$" width="39" /></span> and once the standard deviation of the sample is 0.9622...” (`Student', 1908a, p. 20). Jeffreys (q.v.) (1937) was later to observe exactly how Gosset's derivation coincided with his own based on inverse probability. Interestingly, a treatment of the small sample theory of the mean from the inverse probability perspective had appeared earlier, in a paper by Edgeworth (q.v.) (1883) who also derived the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img12.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -distribution. Edgeworth's derivation, however, was heavily reliant on the form of the prior distribution for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \mu$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img13.png" title="$ \mu$" width="16" /></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ \sigma$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img14.png" title="$ \sigma$" width="16" /></span> , which he assumed had the form <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ C\sigma^{-2} d\mu d\sigma$" border="0" height="38" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img15.png" title="$ C\sigma^{-2} d\mu d\sigma$" width="91" /></span> . Gosset appears to have been unaware of this contribution of Edgeworth. Welch (1958) provides a thorough discussion of Edgeworth's 1883 paper and its connection to `Student's' own work (see also Stigler, 1978). More recently, Pfanzagl and Sheynin (1996) present evidence of an even earlier derivation, in 1876, of a generalization of the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img16.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -distribution by the German mathematician Jakob Lüroth, also from what we would call a Bayesian perspective.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><i>The Correlation Coefficient</i></p>
<p>In addition to the famous article establishing the <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img17.png" title="$ t$" width="12" /></span> -distribution, there appeared in 1908 another effort by `Student', this time dealing with the correlation coefficient (`Student', 1908b). Gosset did not actually succeed in deriving a sampling distribution for <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img18.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> , instead relying on the empirical method used in the first paper to establish properties of the distribution of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img19.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> assuming that <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \rho=0$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img20.png" title="$ \rho=0$" width="49" /></span> . We note that here the inverse probability approach is much more obviously stated than in Gosset's article dealing with the sample mean; in particular, he suggests various “priors” for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \rho$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img21.png" title="$ \rho$" width="14" /></span> , the population correlation. Since he was not able to give a concrete expression for the sampling distribution <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ f(r\vert\rho)dr$" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img22.png" title="$ f(r\vert\rho)dr$" width="73" /></span> , Gosset was also unable to write down the posterior distribution for <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ \rho$" border="0" height="33" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img23.png" title="$ \rho$" width="14" /></span> . Subsequently, in his first major contribution to mathematical statistics, R. A. Fisher (1915) derived the sampling distribution of <span class="MATH"><img align="bottom" alt="$ r$" border="0" height="17" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/43/l2h/img24.png" title="$ r$" width="14" /></span> , using a geometrical argument, and this work led to the famous Fisher-Gosset correspondence. In this same paper, Fisher also established that for the case of normal data under consideration, the mean and standard deviation are not only uncorrelated, but independent.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Gosset on Experimental Design</b></p>
<p>R. A. Fisher's correspondence with Gosset began in 1912, when Fisher sent Gosset a copy of his paper applying maximum likelihood (as it would later come to be known) to estimate the mean and variance of a normal population. They did not meet until a decade later, however, when Gosset visited Rothamsted and presented Fisher with a copy of his statistical tables. They continued to correspond on a variety of topics and, in 1923, there was an exchange of letters between the two on Fisher's work with Mackenzie on the design of experiments, in which Gosset advocated the use of systematic field arrangements, in essence rejecting Fisher's proposal for randomisation. Their disagreement on the use of randomisation continued in private correspondence (see various excerpts in Plackett and Barnard,1990, Chapter 5) and could hardly be read into Gosset's only public criticism of Fisher, in the context of a published comment on the infamous Lanarkshire milk experiment (`Student', 1931).</p>
<p>In 1936, however, the debate became public in a discussion of a paper read before the Royal Statistical Society on `co-operation in large-scale experiments.' Gosset led off the discussion by extolling the virtues of Beaven's half-drill strip systematic design, and Fisher, who spoke next, expressed his opposition to such systematic designs. This was followed by a paper by Fisher and Barbacki criticising `the supposed precision of systematic designs' and an exchange of letters between Fisher and Gosset in <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Gosset was working on a detailed response to Fisher in which he once again put forth his support of systematic experimentation and expressed doubts about the role of randomisation. After so many years, they had not resolved their differences on this fundamental statistical issue. The paper appeared posthumously in 1938, and when he read it Fisher observed in a letter to <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu2" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=53" name="menu2">Harold Jeffreys</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“So far as I can judge, `Student' and I would have differed quite inappreciably on randomisation if we had seen enough of each other to know exactly what the other meant, and if he had not felt in duty bound, not only to extol the merits, but also to deny the defects of Beaven's half drill strip system.<br />
... “I fancy also that Gosset never realised that a fertility gradient when, as in my experience is not very frequent, it is important enough to bother about, can easily be eliminated from a randomised experiment. It is, I think, my fault that I have not made this clear earlier, but until the last two years I had really thought that `Student' accepted all that I had put forward on behalf of randomisation.” (Bennett (1990), pp. 271-272.)</blockquote>

<p><b>John GRAUNT</b><br />
b. 24 April 1620 - d. 18 April 1674<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> Arguably the Father of Modern Statistics, Graunt produced the first life table and, together with William Petty, founded the English School of "Political Arithmetic".</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p>John Graunt was born in London, the eldest child of Henry and Mary Graunt. His father was a draper who had moved to London from Hampshire. Graunt served an apprenticeship and eventually succeeded to his fathers drapery business, becoming quite prosperous. He was made a Freeman of the Drapers' Company at age 21, and eventually rose to the important position of Warden of the Company which he held in 1671-1672. Graunt held various civic offices at the ward level and ultimately on the common council. He was a captain in the (military) band, and a major in his last years (1671-1674). He died on 18 April 1674 at age 53.</p>
<p>Graunt lived in a period of great intellectual activity. It was a period which cradled modern science. The Royal Society of London, which played a seminal role in this, was founded in 1660. The old learning, with its appeal to authority, was being replaced by enquiry and experiment.</p>
<p>In 1662 Graunt published his famous <i>Natural and Political Observations on the London Bills of Mortality</i>. This was the first treatise on vital statistics, and shows the earliest attempt to apply theory, if only “shop arithmetic", to real statistical problems. Later, his friend Sir William Petty (1623-1687) used similar methods on Irish data (principally in <i>The Political Anatomy of Ireland</i> (1672, published 1691) and <i>Observations upon the Dublin Bills of Mortality</i> (1681)). The two men, between them, founded the English School of what was called “Political Arithmetic". Graunt has been assessed by <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu0">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v) as the Father of Modern Statistics.</p>
<p>Graunt explained in the Preface to <i>Observations</i> how he had become interested in the <i>Bills of Mortality</i>, weekly reports whose publication had begun in 1592. These had been a subject of curiosity but he sought to distinguish between impression and fact and found much underlying regularity in the data. He implicitly accepted the stability of statistical ratios, such as the (number of burials/population), and if the ratios were not stable he sought reasons. Thus, when he made what was the first attempt at a life table, he based his results on the twenty years 1629-1636 and 1647-1658 which were relatively less effected by plague <a href="#foot46" id="tex2html1" name="tex2html1"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a>.</p>
<p>The basis on which Graunt made his calculations is not evident, although he may have used a geometric series. Amongst the calculations is an estimate of the size of an army which could be raised in London based on the assumption that there are 107 males for each 100 females. Graunt seems have been the first to make such an observation about the sex ratio. He deduced that 34% of the male population would be aged between 16 and 56. Typical of other calculations are that of 100 persons born, 36 die before age 6 and 7 survive to age 70.</p>
<p>Graunt's first crude life table led on to the mathematical work of Edmund Halley (1656-1742) and thence to the foundations of actuarial science. He had foreseen what we needed, namely the following of a given group from birth to death. As it was, he did not have the ages of individuals at death, and his data was effected by migration into the city of London.</p>
<p>The <i>Observations</i> were well received. On 5 February 1662 50 copies of the book were presented to the Royal Society. A Committee was appointed to examine the book and reported favourably. King Charles II was also impressed and recommended Graunt to the Society, and on 26 February 1662, only a month after publication of the book, Graunt was elected to the Society. In November 1664 he was elected to the Council of the Society and he was a regular participant in Council meetings until April 1666.</p>
<p>Late in his life, Graunt descended into poverty. This started off with the destruction of his house in the Great Fire of London in September 1666. But a major cause was that he ceased his trade and all public offices, apparently on religious grounds, after his conversion to Roman Catholicism. At the time this was a controversial and unpopular step.</p>
<p>There were various further editions of <i>Observations</i> - a second edition in 1662 and a third, much enlarged, and fourth in 1665. A fifth edition appeared in 1676, two years after Graunt's death, apparently overseen by Petty. This contained a very few “further observations".</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Bills of Mortality began to be published in Paris just before 1670, apparently in response to the appearance and evident value of Graunt's <i>Observations</i>. Indeed, Graunt's work led on rather naturally to the universal registration of births, marriages, and causes of death for purposes of the State.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been suggested that Petty was the author of <i>Observations</i> and, indeed, he made some claims to this effect after Graunt's death. But on balance the suggestion does not seem well founded. A careful assessment has been given by Karl Pearson in Pearson (1978, Chapter II). It should be noted, in particular, that Petty was a member (chair) of the Royal Society Committee which considered <i>Observations</i> after its receipt from Graunt in 1662 and reported positively prior to his election to the Society.<br />

<p><b>Emil Julius GUMBEL</b><br />
b. 18 July 1891 - d. 10 September 1966<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary.</b> In spite of a scientific career disrupted by exile (to France in 1932, then to the United States in 1940) the German-born pacifist E.J. Gumbel was the principal architect of the statistical theory of extreme values.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Emil Julius Gumbel was born in Munich (München), Germany, into a family of Jewish origin thoroughly assimilated into the Bavarian middle class and aristocracy. He was a student at the prestigious Kaiser-Wilhelms-Gymnasium where he graduated with his Abitur in July 1910. He then pursued his studies in mathematics and political economy at the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich. He specialized in statistics and obtained an actuarial diploma in February 1913. For the following two semesters (summer 1913 and winter 1913/14) he worked as <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=68" name="menu0">Georg von Mayr</a>'s (q.v.) assistant in his statistical and actuarial seminar, and he was then put in charge of tutorials in mathematical statistics. At the same time, Gumbel wrote his thesis under von Mayr, and on 24 July 1914, he received his doctorate in political economy with the highest grading. His thesis, <i>Die Berechnung des Bevölkerungsstandes durch Interpolation</i> appeared in 1916 in the supplements of E. Roesle's periodical <i>Archiv für soziale Hygiene und Demographie</i>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, war had broken out and Gumbel, like many of his German contemporaries, threw himself passionately into it. Enrolled early as a volunteer, he rapidly became aware and disillusioned by the deceptions perpetrated in the name of German imperial power. Before he could venture onto the battlefield, Gumbel was initially exempted for reasons of health, and later, at the beginning of 1916, permanently excused from military service. In the meantime, he had installed himself in Berlin, where he worked in the Civil Service as an engineer in aeronautical workshops, and later at Telefunken, while militantly active as a pacifist, and again taking up studies (in physics) at Humboldt University. He there came in contact with Albert Einstein and <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=11" name="menu1">Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz</a> (q.v.) at the university and with Einstein also in the pacifist league <i>Bund Neues Vaterland</i>. Bortkiewicz, who was to give a decisive orientation to the career and statistical work of Gumbel, had succeeded Wilhelm Lexis (q.v.) as leader of the Continental Statistical School. Bortkiewicz and Lexis had views opposed to those of Georg von Mayr , who was reluctant to use the calculus of probabilities in dealing with statistical data.</p>
<p>By the end of the first world war, Gumbel had devoted his main efforts to the political struggle. He had placed his statistical expertise at the service of the pacifist and anti-nationalist cause, publishing pamphlets and enquiries on the assassinations carried out by the extreme right, and left largely unpunished by German justice. It was only in 1923 that Gumbel, with Bortkiewicz's help, received his Habilitation at Heidelberg, becoming a Privatdozent in mathematical statistics. The hostility of an increasing number of his colleagues and students to his ideas and his political activity was to plunge his university career into chaos. He was suspended several times, leaving Germany for Moscow in 1926 to work on the mathematical archives of Marx (MEGA project). Despite his nomination as professor extraordinarius, against the advice of his Faculty, Gumbel was eventually ousted from his position at Heidelberg on the eve of the Third Reich. He then found refuge in France, where he was invited to the Institut Henri Poincaré by <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu2" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=10" name="menu2">Emile Borel</a> (q.v.). In 1934 he was welcomed as a foreign assistant at the Institut de Science Financière et d'Assurances in Lyon. With the support of Maurice Fréchet (q.v.) he was appointed to the CNRS (The National Council for Scientific Research) in 1937. The possibility of a university career in France was not to be fulfilled, however, as war broke out again and forced him into a new exile in the USA, where he remained until his death.</p>
<p>Gumbel's support of Bortkiewicz's ideas became more apparent in the 1920's and 1930's. The most notable example of this is a work published by Gumbel in 1932, <i>Das Zufallsgesetz des Sterbens (The Statistical Law Governing Mortality)</i>, which brought to a close both his research on the subject and his activities in Germany; a few months later he was forced into exile. In fact, having spent much effort in rejecting all attempts to establish as demographic laws empirical mathematical formulae depending on interpolation, or on theoretically dubious fitted curves, Gumbel found himself defending the paradoxical idea of a mathematical law relating mortality to age. Its probabilistic nature revealed his debt to Bortkiewicz. It was essentially based on work of Lexis: who had adjusted mortality tables using a Gaussian distribution for those ages considered to be beyond normal. Gumbel extended the formula to the entire table, by considering as variables not the age at death, but the life expectancy at each age. He was then able to enunciate his probabilistic principle as “Unser Leben ist in Gottes Hand,[...] Das Schicksal zieht ein schwarzes Los aus der Urnen der Lebendigen. (Our life is in God's hand [...] Destiny draws a black ball from the ballot-boxes of those living." The statistics of mortality could then be treated as analogous to an urn model, a model which was then considered to be the basis of the calculus of probabilities (as in K. Pearson's (q.v.) curves or “Laws"). Hence the word “Gesetz (Law)" in the title of Gumbel's work, which is an allusion to the famous <i>Das Gesetz der kleinen Zahlen</i> (1898) of Bortkiewicz.</p>
<p>Gumbel's French period is arguably his most fertile one, with his scientific activities hardly affected by political harassment. During the 1930's he remained an active militant anti-Nazi, together with other exiled intellectuals. When he came to France, he brought with him a new idea, that of extreme values, which was to occupy his thoughts for the rest of his life and ensure his enduring renown. Certain formulas of fit, for example those of de Moivre (q.v.) and Wittstein, consider a survival table as stopping at the age at which no further survivors remain. Around 1930, the Danish mathematician Steffensen rekindled discussion on the topic by pointing out the difficulties of such a hypothesis, in that statistical distributions most used by actuaries, among them mainly those of Gompertz-Makeham, and of Gauss-Lexis, only tend to zero asymptotically. Gumbel's innovation consisted in the redefinition of the limiting age, on the basis of the calculus of probabilities. He introduced a new random variable, the “oldest age" of a generation, whose mode was to be called “final age" and whose expectation only designated the “limiting age". The new distribution differs in general from that describing the population. By approximating the size of the population, the distribution of the maximum age may be modelled by one of the asymptotic laws of extreme values. Having used his ideas on different tables, Gumbel collected his contributions in a 1937 monograph of the series in mathematical statistics edited by G. Darmois (q.v.) entitled <i>La durée extrême de la vie humaine</i>.</p>
<p>In developing his “theory of the maximum value", Gumbel rediscovered, extended and correlated several publications on extremes carried out at the turn of the century by various authors who were apparently unaware of each other's work. Some belonged to the Continental School such as Bortkiewicz and R. von Mises (q.v.), to whom one might add the Pole <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu3" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=77" name="menu3">Jerzy Neyman</a> (q.v.), and the American E.L. Dodd. Another contingent consisted of British biometricians, F. Galton (q.v.), K. Pearson, L.H.C. Tippett and R.A. Fisher (q.v.). Finally, the Frenchmen J. Bertrand (q.v.), J. Haag, and especially M. Fréchet and the Italian B.de Finetti also made substantial contributions to the extreme value problem. The theoretical structure was completed in 1943 with the statement and proof of the theorem on the limit of extremes, in central limit style, by B.V. Gnedenko, There are only three kinds of limit laws possible for the maximum value, all characterized by their “max-stability": the distribution of the maximum value, apart from a change of scale and unit, remains the same as that of the sample from which it comes. This relates the statistical theory of extremes to that of the addition of random variables, as for example in Paul Lévy's work. One of the three limiting distributions had been found by M. Fréchet in 1926. The second was named after Weibull (1887-1979), a Swedish engineer , who applied it to problems of confidence from the mid 1930's. Finally, Gumbel stressed the theoretical and practical interest of the last distribution, which was logically given his name. This, apart from a change of scale, has distribution function <span class="MATH"><img align="middle" alt="$ G(x) = exp(exp(-x)), x \geq 0 $" border="0" height="37" src="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/cache/objects/45/l2h/img1.png" title="$ G(x) = exp(exp(-x)), x \geq 0 $" width="236" /></span> .</p>
<p>Gumbel, by his interdisciplinary and transnational skills, his polyglot abilities, and his applied mathematician's flair, was able to bring to light and exploit a body of theoretical work and prove its practical use by applying his results to several areas. The first was demography, followed by cases of radioactivity in collaboration with the Curies, and finally and most importantly the fields of hydrology and meteorology. From 1937 on, first in France and after 1940 in the USA, he became an expert forecaster of river floods, and later of their drought levels, and other extreme climatic phenomena.</p>
<p>Unable to find a university position in the USA, Gumbel acted as a consultant to different government organizations, even including NATO. It was only in 1953 that he was appointed to a chair at Columbia University. He was also elected to the membership of the ISI, with the support of M. Fréchet among others.</p>
<p>His contributions are summarized in his book <i>Statistics of Extremes</i>. This was published in New York in 1958 and is the first treatise devoted entirely to this field. It was widely disseminated, mainly to engineers, with further editions in 1960 and up to 1979, while a Japanese translation appeared in 1963 and a Russian edition under the direction of Gnedenko in 1965.<br />

<p><b>Austin Bradford HILL</b><br />
b. 8 July 1897 - d. 18 April 1991<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Summary</b>. Bradford Hill was the leading proponent of randomized clinical trials during the mid-20th century, and conducted important epidemiogic surveys especially for the health effects of smoking. His writings were very influential.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>By the end of the 1930's Bradford Hill had achieved distinction as a respected medical statistician who had written an influential introductory book on the subject. During the next 25 years he occupied an undisputed place as the leading medical statistician, a position justified by the important developments he initiated in epidemiology and clinical trials and the consequent contributions to medical knowledge.</p>
<p>Hill was born in London and died in Cumbria, England. He was always known as `<a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu0" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=111" name="menu0">Tony</a>', and adopted the double surname `Bradford Hill' later in life, and he came from a family of considerable distinction. His father, Sir Leonard Hill, was an eminent physiologist and Fellow of the Royal Society. His 19th century forebears included Sir Rowland Hill, who introduced the penny post in Great Britain. Hill had expected to follow his father in medicine, but, during wartime service with the Royal Naval Air Service, he contracted tuberculosis which led to a long period of convalescence. The prospect of a medical career having disappeared, he took a London University degree in economics, and obtained a post in a research group in industrial medicine under Major Greenwood, the leading medical statistician at that time.</p>
<p>Hill liked to tell people that he was trained in neither medicine nor statistics. He had attended lectures by <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu1" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=82" name="menu1">Karl Pearson</a> (q.v.), who greatly impressed him, but he never developed a liking for mathematical theory and in later life preferred to describe himself as an epidemiologist. During the inter-war period his research covered a wide range of epidemiological work, but centered on occupational health. He moved, with Greenwood, to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where he became a Reader in 1933. His lectures to postgraduate medical students were inspiring, and helped to persuade a generation of future public health workers of the central importance of the statistical approach. This vein of incisive exposition continued in a series of articles in the <i>Lancet</i>, which were published in book form in as <i>Principles of Medical Statistics</i> (Hill, 1937; Hill and Hill, 1991). This book, which was immensely successful, had minimal technical content, but explained clearly the general principles of the subject and the problems of interpretation of statistical data.</p>
<p>After the war, during which he worked for the Royal Air Force, Hill succeeded Greenwood as Professor of Medical Statistics and directed the Statistical Research Unit of the Medical Research Council (MRC). Between 1945 and his retirement in 1961 he directed research in a number of major projects, many of which were funded by the MRC.</p>
<p>In 1946 he persuaded two MRC committees to launch randomized controlled trials, one in preventive medicine to <a class="StatWiki dropdown" id="menu2" href="http://encyclopedia-dev.springerwiki.com/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=130" name="menu2">test</a> a pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine, the other in clinical medicine to assess the effect of streptomycin in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. The report on the latter (Medical Research Council, 1948) is generally regarded as marking the first randomized trial (Armitage, 1992). Hill had advocated randomization in his book, although he had not initially distinguished clearly between strictly random allocation and the more suspect method of alternation. The streptomycin trial was an opportunity to clarify his thoughts, and there followed a remarkable stream of writing on the principles of clinical trials including practical and ethical problems, exemplified by further trials supported by the MRC and other bodies. Many of these accounts are included in a volume of selected papers (Hill, 1962).</p>
<p>Meanwhile he launched, with Richard Doll, a major case-control study (Doll and Hill, 1950), comparing lung cancer patients with matched controls, which showed conclusively that smoking was the predominant risk factor. This was followed by other case-control studies, and, again with Doll, a long-term prospective study of smoking and health which demonstrated that lung cancer was not the only disease to be caused by smoking. This cohort study, which continued for several decades, was conducted on British doctors, an ideal population whose cooperation was testimony to the respect with which Hill's work was regarded by his medical colleagues. As with clinical trials, Hill accompanied his work on specific epidemiological projects with expositions of the principles to be followed in this field of research (Hill, 1962). In particular, in Hill (1965) he proposed nine criteria which should be satisfied before one could confidently claim that an association between a disease and a risk factor was causative. Hill was by nature a cautious man, and he had been careful initially to claim that a causal effect of smoking on lung cancer was only one of a number of possible explanations for the association. As the evidence mounted he accpeted the causal link as being overwhelmingly the most likely explanation, and was disturbed by sceptical remarks occasionally expressed by eminent scientists unwilling to take a commonsense view of the matter.</p>
<p>Hill was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1954 and knighted in 1961. He was President of the Royal Statistical Society in 1950-52 and was honoured by many other learned institutions. After retirement he became one of the first members of the UK committee set up to regulate the safety of drugs, later known as the Committee on Safety of Medicines.</p>
<p>Hill made, during his career, little use of any but the simplest mathematical techniques, but gave strong support to colleagues whose inclination lay in that direction. His success was due to a combination of factors: enormous ability as a research strategist, able to see the right way to tackle a difficult problem and to develop the means of doing so; a remarkable facility with numerical data, which enabled him to see the essential features of data summaries without technical analysis; a very sharp intellect, highly effective in committee discussions; and a charming and witty personality engendering confidence amongst medical colleagues who might otherwise have resented the interventions of an `outsider'. His influence on younger colleagues was considerable, and his standing as a pioneer in the continued advance of quantitative medical research is unchallenged.<br />
