A FileCache object is created by calling new FileCache($filename).  If the
given file has been opened since last restart, and has not been modified
since the last time it was opened, then an old copy of the file contents is
returned.  This means that there is a stat call and a time call for each
file request using a FileCache.  To obtain the contents, simply call the
getText method on the object.  One can force a reload by calling the reload
method on the object.  Otherwise a reload only occurs in the object
constructor, and only if the modification time on the requested file is
more recent than the last cache time.

The point of this is so that files can be changed at runtime without
requiring a restart of apache.  It's not a big deal, but neither was adding
it.  Any stemplate can now be modified at runtime without any restart
required.
