papers will be able to be submitted by the authors or any planetmath user

two submission methods:

1 ) wget URL. if the URL to a copy of the paper, already online, is known, this can simply be given and a local wget or wget-like program on planetmath will download it

2 ) ftp account.  users with space on planetmath, which is accessible by ftp, will be able to simply give a path relative to their web space to a file within it, presumeably a paper.
