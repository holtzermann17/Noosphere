Sat Nov  8 19:20:03 UTC 2003  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0102

  1. PlanetMath mail will now by default result in an e-mail notification. 
     This can be turned off with a new preference, "Also send email for each 
     system notice?".

  2. The notification metadata for message posts/replies has been updated, so
     that the first few lines of the post content will actually appear as the
     comment of the notice. This also means users get a "preview" of the post
     within email, if they have notice emails turned on.  To accommodate this
     change, the subject of the post was combined with the subject of the 
     notice, as in 

       "Re: message post subject" (reply)

	 or 
  
       "message post subject" (post)

  3. Auto-hyperlinking of post content has been made much smarter.  It was 
     also failing regarding whitespace bugginess before.

  4. The post screen now has some guidance about entering posts as ASCII, and
     letting Noosphere do the hyperlinking automatically.

Wed Oct 15 04:40:44 UTC 2003  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0101

  1. Added parallel notice email feature.

Thu Jun 12 01:15:02 UTC 2003  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0100

  1. Added support for Mysql and switched PlanetMath over to Mysql.  There are
     plenty more bugs to stamp out here.

Wed Feb 26 06:18:32 UTC 2003  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0099

  1. Added multiple-editing colission handling: now check-outs are stamped with
     a version, and if the database version of an object goes up, the checked
     out version is not allowed in.  In this situation, the user is told to 
     go open a new edit for the object and to copy over/integrate the changes
     they were working on.

  2. Added a version roll-back for object owners.  This simply replaces the 
     current version of an object with the selected version (from the history
     page) and tosses out all revisions after it.   The rollback behavior could
     be nicer, but this should suffice for easy combatting of malicious edits.

Sun Dec 15 09:23:55 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0098

  1. Added emailing for object transfer events.

  2. Added user preferences for converting these emails into notices.

  3. Added "cite" to list of commands that require reruning LaTeX.  Abstracted
     this list to "$reruns" variable.

  4. Misc changes.

Wed Dec  4 19:45:59 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0097

  1. Make "user activity" page viewable to all logged-in users.

  2. Cut off number of users shown on "user activity" page to last 50.

  3. Fixed a bug where the comment and subject were reversed in notices sent
     for object edits.

Sat Nov  2 20:51:22 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0096

  1. Added correction retraction, whereby the filer of a correction can
     "cancel" the correction without ever having to wait for the target user
     to reject it.  

  2. To go along with the above, the "edit corrections" functionality was split
     into two sections: "corrections to your objects", and "corrections you've
     filed".  From the latter, one can now click on "-" to retract a pending
     correction.

  3. When viewing a correction they have filed,  a "retract this correction"
     control appears.

Wed Sep 25 20:10:47 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0095

  1. Cleaned up login behavior.  No longer should double submits from clients
     cause people to get registered twice.  Also, the bug where being 
     registered twice prevented people from logging in has also been removed.

  2. Added account deactivation and reactivation.  When an account is 
     deactivated, the user cannot log in.  THey are informed of this when they
     attempt to log in.

  3. Added account deletion.  For content integrity purposes, this is not
     allowed unless the user hasn't created any objects.

  4. Added an admin control for the above to the user display page.

  5. Added globals to all templates, for things like site URLs.  This needs to
     be employed in all templates, so no locations are hardcoded.

Sun Sep 15 04:22:57 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0094

  1. Cleaned up user objects list.  This now shows objects in all sections,
     not just encyclopedia. 

  2. Added in an event hook so that anyone who is watching an object gets a
     notice when someone edits it, with the revision comment included.

Wed Sep 11 15:07:12 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0093

  1. Added groupings to user preferences, so they appear more organized.

  2. Improved the search engine a bit: put stemming and stopping in the 
     correct order; combined the df list with the dictionary itself.

Tue Sep 10 02:58:26 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0092

  1. Added "Cache Control" admin feature.  This allows viewing cached fields 
     in a variety of groups (stats, encyclopedia, file) and selectively 
     invalidating elements of these groups.  

Sat Sep  7 22:32:50 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0091

  1. Removed "Typographical" correction type; added "Meta" correction type.
     Meta is typographical + anything about the entry's metadata (that is, not
     the mathematical content.)  Also made the correction filing screen more
     user-friendly, with an online help blurb for the types.

Wed Sep  4 12:58:38 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0090

  1. Added a "permissions" item to the user menu.  This is very similar to the
     ACL editor for a single object (in fact, the functionality was folded into
     the same subroutine), except it is of global scope.  Here, users can 
     configure their default ACL which gets applied to each new object they
     create, and they can retroactively apply this default ACL to all of their
     objects.

  2. Added a "view" item to the user box next to "your info" which lets users 
     quickly jump to their user info page, as others see it.

  3. Reworded some things on the "owner controls" box.

  4. Updated some statistics stuff; was missing deletion updates.

Sun Sep  1 10:07:29 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0089

  1. Added a "Statistics Caching" system (StatCache.pm) which eliminates the 
     need to frequently recalculate nontrivial statistics (for example, the top
     user list and latest additions/modifications are all extremely processor
     and disk intensive to produce).  Essentially, this "lazifies" the
     production of these statistics.  They are cached in a database hash and 
     can either be invalidated directly by portions of the system in response
     to events, or invalidated due to timeouts (this is useful for the 
     last-two-weeks top user list).  This should greatly increase the speed of
     the system.

Thu Aug 29 18:44:31 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0088

  1. Added "Typographical" correction type.

Tue Aug 27 21:40:31 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0087

  1. Moved "view history" control out of owner/admin boxes and into the display
     of each object's metadata that everyone can see.  There was really no 
     reason to hide this.

  2. Added convenient "create editor group" to the one-click control panel
     owners of an object see.  This allows the owner of an object to quickly
     create a group which has write permissions to that object.  After clicking
     this control, the user is placed in the group configuration screen.

  3. Greatly augmented the group "member editor" screen, such that it is now a
     generic "group configuration" screen.  Added title/description change 
     functionality and cleaned up the arrangement of widgets.

     Also, added auto name-to-id resolution, so users can input either name or
     user id to add members to their groups.  

     For when this fails, I've added a blurb explaining that you can simply 
     find users in the search engine, and directly add them to a group from 
     their "user info" page.

Tue Aug 27 00:45:45 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0086

  1. Rearranged and added to the "ACL editor" page.  Now there is a select box
     which allows the user to choose an existing group they admin to be the 
     subject of the access rule.  This eliminates the need to look up a group
     id.

  2. Added some code to set a "default" revision comment for when a 
     correction is accepted.  This should make the object editing history 
     display a little more useful.

  3. Added a new preference for auto-watching corrections filed *to* one's own
     objects (by other people).  This is on by default.  (should have been 
     added long ago).

Mon Aug 26 00:51:16 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0085

  1. New, improved mathytitle implementation.  This one is built around a 
     generic math-chunk rendering architecture, and a hash table of image
     binaries in the database.  New mathytitle images generated on demand.

  2. Fixed a problem with TeX->UTF8 ichar conversion by making a new TeXtoUTF8
     which does NOT convert the entire string to latin1 (only the TeX ichars.)
     For the old functionality, TeXtoUTF8_fromLatin1 should be used.

Sun Aug 25 20:51:35 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0084

  1. Added to encyclopedia interact menu an "update request" link.  This 
     sends the user to the request fulfilled updater, with the canonical name 
     of the referring object already filled-in.

Sun Aug 25 16:12:50 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0083

  1. Reorganized so that the Books/Papers/Expositions sections are all done
     by a single, generic module.  XSLTized most of it too.

Wed Aug 21 10:31:46 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0082

  1. XSLified encyclopedia add/edit forms.

  2. Made considerable changes to the XSLTemplate engine.  Added some key stuff
     to make it more compatible with plain html Templates and how we were 
     using them (such as setKey* functions).  

     Also added DOCTYPE entity definition stuff to the XSL tranformation 
     source text header (sorely needed). 

  3. Added "proves self" to encyclopedia edit and add forms.

Tue Aug 20 07:02:16 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0081

  1. Added a database admin interface.  It revolves around a freeform query
     interface, however, it is a little smarter: when possible, it slips oids
     into the result set of rows on a select, and uses these as keys to allow
     updates and deletes of arbitrary returned rows.  

     Also there is a "get info" command, and a table dropdown, so one can 
     quickly retrieve the schema and index information (as well as table size)
     for any table.

     Missing is a "query builder" interface, which would be especially useful
     for things like inserting new rows in arbitrary tables, based on their
     schema (perhaps this should be added by itself, since updates and deletes
     are fast enough using the freeform query interface.)

     Unfortunately, this is all very postgres-centric.  I don't see any way to
     generalize, not even through DBI.

Fri Aug  9 21:30:23 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0080

  1. Implemented "mathytitles."  This means that titles containing short math
     sequences like $\pi$ will be replaced with actual symbols.  This isn't
     exhaustive; its really only meant for representing very clumsy symbols
     or bb/cal fonts, or greek letters.  Things like $p$-adic will be left
     alone.  

  2. Cleaned up admin qwik-edit a bit and made it so that it actually saves
     version snapshots.

Fri Jul 26 16:19:51 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0079

  1. Put in the "prompt notice" system.  This allows notices to be sent which
     require (allow) a choice to be made, as a selection among alternatives. 
     When the user clicks on a choice (or deletes the notice), an action is
     performed.

  2. Used the above to add "Ask" as an option for accepting of symmetric
     "related" link behavior.  In other words, now you can set this preference 
     to "Ask" (instead of just "Yes" or "No"), and you will receive a prompt
     notice which allows one-click accepting (and zero-click rejecting) of 
     a related link which completes relation symmetry.

Thu Jul 25 10:45:29 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0078

  1. Rearranged getEncyclopediaExtras (the display of info below an encyc.
     entry) to be more readable.  "See Also" is now first, as per someone's
     suggestion.  

Wed Jul 10 23:44:08 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0077

  1. Changed the schema of the "users" table so that the prefs field is "text"
     rather than "varchar(255)".  This makes the length effectively unlimited
     and solves some problems that were occurring (prefs wouldn't update.).
     The schema definition file (pm.sql) has been updated to reflect this, and
     all of the table contents have been converted.

Wed Jul 10 23:22:26 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0075

  1. Introduced notice-sending for situations where users have set their 
     preferences to avoid receiving email upon correction events (such as 
     correction closing for the filer, correction reception for the author.)

Wed Jul 10 01:48:22 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0074

  1. Changed the main operation dispatch method in PlanetMath from a (shameful)
     practice of chaining together a bunch of string comparisons with "elsifs" 
     to a hash-based lookup with the op name as key.  Not that I see any speed 
     increase (though there should be one in principle), but this is just a 
     better way to do things.

Mon Jul  8 06:12:30 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0073

  1. Added control on user display page which allows the page viewer to easily
     add the displayed user to any of the viewers groups, via a select box.
     Combined with the ability to pull up users in the search engine, this 
     entirely removes the need to directly enter in user IDs when defining
     groups.

  2. Made category IDs clickable on long classification printouts.  Clicking
     on the ID will now bring you to the MSC browse listing for that category,
     allowing you to see other entries for the same subject.

Mon Jul  8 02:55:59 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0072

  1. Added notice-sending for adding-user-to-group and removing-user-from-
     group events.

  2. Cleaned up new XSL user info display a bit, "From" is no longer shown
     when all 3 fields (city, state, country) are left blank.  Same goes for
     "Name."

Mon Jul  8 02:22:15 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0071

  1. Fixed a bug which surfaced because now things others than encyclopedia
     entries are in the object index.  In short, there was spurious info 
     showing up in the "user corrections received" statistics because 
     encyclopedia objects weren't being selected on.

  2. Modified the user generic object listing template so that when there is
     an empty listing, a message is displayed.

Sun Jul  7 20:18:50 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0070

  1. Added password change service to handle forgotten passwords.

Fri Jul  5 06:41:44 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0069

  1. Users are now (title and IR) indexed.  This process happens at activation
     time, of course.

  2. Users now show up in the search engine.  I spiffed up the generic object
     search engine result rendering code since its being used to show the
     user results.

  3. Changed user info display to XSL template framework.  Added the ability
     to call getUser from GetObj, so users are now generic "objects."

     To make the XSL template I used behave like old-sk00l templates, I had to
     put in stub setKey() and requestsKey() methods.  These could concievably
     do meaningful things at some point (but only in a heuristical sense.) See
     the code for more details.

     Note that without these stubs, you cannot use a GetObj handler that 
     returns an XSL template.

Fri Jul  5 02:35:25 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0068

  1. Fixed up the "cleanCmp" function that is supposed to sort things for
     the encyclopedia index view.  It was, in reality, doing nothing.

  2. Fixed up the "mangleTitle" function.  It is now considerably more robust,
     and the prefix "the" is also taken care of.  To see that this works,
     look under "T" in the encyclopedia and note that none of the titles start
     with "the."

Thu Jun 27 00:42:17 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0067

  1. Added exact match to search engine.  Exact matches of the query string
     against object titles are promoted to the top of the results list.

  2. Removed visibility of author controls to non-logged-in users.

Mon Jun 24 03:22:21 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0066

  1. Updated the encyclopedia alphabetical index.  Now goofy characters
     like quotes will not appear as index characters.  Also, names like
     "proof of X" are mangled to "X, proof of" for proper alphabetization.

     This was all achieved through expanding the objindex table and adding
     an index character (ichar field) which is derived from a mangled name
     at title indexing time.  Hence, the logic does not have to be repeated
     for each item at display time.
     
  2. Finally put in some date pretty-printing for messages.  Now you only
     see date and hour:minute.  The date is shown as month/day if the current
     year matches the message posting year, otherwise its yyyy-mm-dd.

Sat Jun 15 22:36:28 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0065

  1. Added preamble viewer.  

Wed Jun 12 06:54:40 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0064

  1. Overloaded the current MSC browser so that it can handle browsing
     without a "from" parameter.  In this situation, it will just allow 
     traversal of the entire MSC tree, with appropriate modifications 
     regarding not showing any objects filed in the categories.

Sat Jun  8 18:03:30 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0063

  1. Added 8-bit char searchability to MSC search engine (by converting from         latin 1 to HTML entities).  Other updates to character set function 
     names.  See bug #54.

Fri Jun  7 10:31:40 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0062

  1. Finally updated the main "objects" table.  I cleaned out some vestigial
     columns (like revid), and expanded synonyms, defines, keywords, and 
     relateds to "text" fields to remove length limit restrictions. Also    
     extended title and canonical name field to 255 characters from 128.

     Since PG doesn't have a column drop, I had to create a temporary table
     with the updated schema, then INSERT INTO SELECT ... FROM the old table.
     Then I issued a rename (ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO ...) and re-created
     the indices.

Thu Jun  6 02:31:55 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0061

  1. Added "showwatchers" op.  This op takes an object pointer as a parameter
     and returns a list of all users who have watches set for that object.

  2. Made the word "Watch" in the watch widget a hyperlink to the above.

  3. Put a pager on the messages display.

  4. Rearranged some of the watch updating interface stuff.  Changed the param
     ordering of updateWatches.  Added updateEventWatches, which has only one
     context object instead of two.  This was used to add notice sending for
     the request fulfillment confirming/denying events.  Also, preferences were
     added so users can select if they want watches added automatically for when
     they fill a request, when they report that others have filled a request, or
     when others report that they've filled a request. 

     In summary, users will now be notified of when all key request-related 
     events take place.

  5. Updated normal correction filing so that when a correction is filed, all 
     users watching that object receive notice of the correciton.  This should be
     especially useful for those who are co-authors of an object and want to keep
     tabs on it.

Thu May 30 12:24:33 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0060

  1. Fixed unproven theorem count, changed it (and the listing query) to
     use a left outer join.

Wed May 29 17:28:29 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0059

  1. Put in the "read" portion of a version control system.  This means that
     now the system is saving snapshots of all revisions, and also that 
     editors/authors/admins can view these snapshots.  
  
     Some sort of diffing is still needed.

     And perhaps in the distant future, a way to render the old snapshots.

Tue May 28 11:54:11 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0058

  1. Put in the beginnings of a version management system.  From this point
     on, all revisions of entries will result in an XML snapshot being saved
     on the system.  The next step is to make a "revision browser" type system
     so that editors can inspect revisions.  After that, rollback capability
     should be added.  What would be really neat here is to send a notice to
     all modifiers whose changes are cancelled informing them that this has
     happened.  

Fri May 24 12:27:03 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0057

  1. Generalized and XSLTized user object listings.  This could be the 
     beginnings of a simple, generic paging architecture.  I should experiment
     with adding generic sorting controls to it sometime.  

     Took advantage of this system to add listings of all corrections a user
     has both filed and received.

  2. Added hit count to encyclopedia extras display.  Also made a hits detail
     page accessible from here which shows hits in last day, week, month, year,
     and altogether.

Wed May 22 08:54:40 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0056

  1. Added handling for international characters.  In specific, this means that
     linking works from TeX-forms of international strings to iso-8859-1
     internationalized strings.  

	 In addition, linking is done between properly internationalized titles
     in iso-8859-1 to raw ASCII strings which are "approximations" of the 
     internationalized versions.  So for example, "adele group" will link to
     an entry called "adèle group".

Tue May 21 08:22:12 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0055

  1. Added unclassified objects list.  Eventually, when the confirmation notice
     system is constructed, I'd like to allow any users to simply suggest
     classifications right from this list.

Sun May 19 01:55:49 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0054

  1. Added "quality" and "productivity" metrics to user list page.  See the
     the page itself for more information.

Fri May 17 00:26:26 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0053

  1. Hacked up support for antialiasing within graphics (such as anything
     included via \includegraphics).  This drastically improves the quality
     of diagrams.  (Thanks to Ross Moore on this one.)

Wed May 15 22:50:07 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0052

  1. Canned the old user defuault ACL table and replaced it with a version
     that supports arbitrary ACL rules (not just ones of "default" type). This
     was needed to support access rules for default "write" to the user's
     self-named group.

  2. Updated new user creation code to create a group for the user, this had
     been left out.

  3. Updated new user creation code to add user default ACL rules for the 
     following rules: rule type "default", "everyone can read", and rule type
     "normal", "anyone in the user's self-named group can write".

Tue May 14 05:38:17 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0051

  1. Added code to notify users when corrections are filed to objects they
     are watching (if they aren't the owner or filer.) Should this be 
     extended to correction closing, and perhaps any object editing?

Tue May 14 05:01:25 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0050

  1. Added a control when admin views a request to deny the request. This
     removes all fulfillment information from the database so that the 
     request will appear with the unfulfilled requests.

Mon May 13 22:49:33 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0049

  1. Fixed capitalization linking foibles. For example, "Binomial Theorem"
     would not get linked because the actual object doesn't have "Theorem"
     capitalized in the title.  Changed bareword() to return lower-case, and
     modified istagged() so that it is false if the only change of a word
     transformed by bareword() is capitalization.

Fri May 10 22:58:09 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0048

  1. Added a pager and sorting widget for the user list. We might want to
     copy + generalize this sorting widget (like we did for the paging
     widget).  

  2. Renamed the page widget from getPageWidget to getPager.

Wed May  8 21:44:18 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0047

  1. XSLTized mscBrowse, added stemplates/mscbrowse.xsl

Tue May  7 01:47:58 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0046

  1. Now SplitLaTeX() tries to escape bibliographies from automatic 
     linking.  This is done by escaping text beginning with one of the
     following strings, and continuing to the end of the entry:
      
      \begin{thebibliography}
      {\bf References}
      {\bf Further Reading}
    
	 Surely we will need to add more, in time.  Also, the recombining
     sub had to be updated to handle the fact that escaped portions can
     be nested; instead of simply looping through the escaped portions 
     once, it simply replaces all @@[0-9]+@@ found with the appropriate
     escaped sequence until there are no more of these escape codes left.

Mon May  6 07:31:36 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0045

  1. Small change in code, major ramifications: correction filers no longer
     get any points for accepted corrections to entries they have permissions
     to edit directly.  We don't prevent them from actually filing a
     correction, since this sort of bookkeeping can be useful.

     Changed code in closeCorrection().

Sun May  5 08:01:09 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0044

  1. Added an "author list" to object displaying.  You can see this at work
     in the "extension field" entry (# 703), which has now been edited by
	 djao, though it is owned by drini.

Sat May  4 13:08:18 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0043

  1. Added some preliminary XSLT support.  With a little work this will be
     an excellent replacement of the previous template systems.

  2. Templatized the Requests page, as further proof of concept.  Was able
     to generalize the *Box functions from Layout.pm as XSL templates,
     and successfully called these templates from the open request list
     template.  I think we'll be able to eventually successfully apply
     XSLT to all our pages, but it will take a while to convert everything.

Thu May  2 23:26:33 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0042

  1. Serious repairs to the message posting notification system.  Basically, 
     it never worked right.  There wasn't even any hope for it.  Most changes
     were made to updateWatches().  Redesigned the handling for duplicate
     notification-- now instead of trying to guess a priori whether notices were
     sent to a user, we simply keep track of whether notices were sent before
     processing reply notification.

Wed May  1 08:14:36 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0041

  1. Modified "other text escaping" regex of splitLaTeX to escape any begin
     and end commands not escaped by the previous mechanisms (so
     \begin{center} would not be cross-referenced).  This might need to
     be handled more gracefully.

Wed Apr 24 00:55:35 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0040

  1. ACL data structures and primitive handler functions implemented.  Now
     getObj() checks ACL permissions before serving up an object.  This should
     be the general method for determining if a user has read/write/ACL 
     access to some object.  Default ACLs for users, defaults copied over upon
     object creation.  ACL editor needs to be finished.

Sun Apr 21 22:00:16 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0039

  1. Nicities for MSC search engine: you can now search for MSC ids.  Also,
     results returned have clickable IDs, which link into the MSC tree.

Sun Apr 21 19:48:19 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0038

  1. Added "up" arrow images to corrections and all attachment objects.

  2. Fixed stats to show new types on "latest" lists.

Wed Apr 17 03:07:54 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0037

  1. Added "Application" type.  This is kind of like an "Example" object, in
     terms of status and relation to other objects.

Wed Apr 17 01:15:03 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0036

  1. Separated TODO list into sections: interface, infrastructure, and data
     provision.

Wed Apr 17 01:02:52 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0035

  1. Updated newuser guide (newuser.html) to reflect changes in the type system
     and the addition of a "defines" field to objects.

Tue Apr 16 23:14:21 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0034

  1. Many changes to put in a richer type system.  Firstly, completely updated
     Config.pm structures to reflect new types Example, Corollary, Conjecture,
     Derivation, Example, and Result.  Unified two hashes, since one was just
     the reverse of the other.

  2. Second, updated templates for encyclopedia adding and editing.  "proof"
     was changed everywhere to "parent", since now a parent is needed for more
     than just proofs.

  3. Updated encyclopedia interact sub to return a menu with provisions for
     the new types.  I.e, derivations to definitions, corollaries and results
	 to theorems, proofs to conjectures, and examples to any object type.

  4. Miscellaneous other replacements of "proof" param with "parent".

  5. Added a Util function to determine if a type (given as either integer or
     string) is an attachment type, called isAttachmentType.

Sun Apr 14 01:02:19 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0033

  1. Fixed the spellcheck on message posting bug.  This was another bug left
     over from the initial template implementation; setKey was called for the
     wrong template object (it should have been $post->setKey).

  2. Fixed some unquoting issues for the returned spellcheck text.  Also put
     the text in singlequotes to avoid shell-escaping.

Sat Apr 13 23:25:42 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0032

  1. Added messages for correction objects. Corrections are now standard
     objects and are retrieved through "getObj()".

  2. Added generalized watches. There's now a getWatchWidget function.  Also,
     getObj() automagically takes care of setting watches and displaying the
     toggle widget, provided a "watch" key is present in the template.

  3. Watches are automatically set for corrections and requests filed.

  4. Now only registered users can post requests.  There's a link on the 
     error message screen that comes back when an anonymous user tries to file
     a request, which goes to the "newuser" function.

Sat Apr 13 19:28:39 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0031

  1. Added a valid userid check to the "adoptObject" function.  The lack of
     this check meant that anonymous users could adopt objects, which led to
     what can only be called amusing results. See bug 53.

Fri Apr 12 16:39:02 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0030

  1. Added to the beggining of splitLaTeX in Crossref.pm a line to bracket
     entry text in spaces.  This fixes some boundary cases which case the
     splitting regexps to fail (see bug 51, which is about an entry that 
     starts with $X$.)

Wed Apr 10 13:55:25 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0029

  1. Added display of previous owner for orphaned objects in orphanage().

Wed Apr 10 13:43:44 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0028

  1. Fixed the adoptable object query in orphanage().  The query was not 
     at all taking into account the oldest correction for a given object,
     as makes sense.  The query had to be replaced with a more complex 
     GROUPed sub-query and wrapper super-query.

Sun Apr  7 15:02:10 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0027

  1. Finally added error output reporting for entry adding/editing.  This 
     basically just replaces the normal planetmath.html output with some 
     post-processed output from error.out (which is a new file created by 
     directing both stderr and stdout from the latex2html process.)  So, now
     it is easier to write entries "on-line"-- God have mercy on our CPU.

Tue Mar 12 15:18:44 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0026

  1. Auto orphaning was broken; it was orphaning an object which was actually
     the correction ID.  This is fixed.  Also, it would have been orphaning
     every object which has a 2 week outstanding correction, if it hadn't been
     for the fact that it was crashing on the first object it tried to orphan.

Sat Mar  9 08:31:25 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0025

  1. Got the query spellfixer up and running.  It takes the form of a daemon
     which is in the bin directory, called "spelld".  It basically just sits
     there and listens for requests on TCP port 3060 (changable in the config)
     for some input.  When a client connects and prints a sentence (which is
     meant to be a query), it splits the query up and looks for all of the
     words in the lexicon.  This is done using n-gram indexing, approximated
     Ukkonen distance, and finally Levenshtein distance as a fine-grained 
     comparison metric.  The daemon then returns a sentence which contains one
     word for each input word.  The results are "+" for a word in the lexicon,
     "-" for a word not in the lexicon and which couldn't be corrected, and
     a replacement word for words not in the lexicon which corrections were
     found for.  In Search.pm is a fixQuery() sub which acts as a client that
     sends a query to this daemon, and parses the output into a replacement 
     query.  If any "-" words result, it gives up.  Much more work needs to be 
     done; for instance, the spell daemon should probably output a "-" if its 
     suggestion ends up having a Levenshtein distance which is above some 
     threshold. 
  
  2. Found and fixed a bug in the search engine whereby a divide by zero would
     occur for queries on words which exist in the index, but do not occur 
     in any documents.  Also synched the query df weighting with the method
     of weighting based on df for the document vectors.

Fri Mar  8 01:27:46 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0024

  1. Changed how start and end tags are saved in cross-referencing.  There is
     now an array kept with the start and end tags for every word in the 
     anchor text.  Also added a preprocessLaTeX sub which does some of the 
     junk that was at the end of splitLaTeX (but shouldn't have been).  Also
     put a hack in this that changes "{\it foo}" type attribute settings to
     "{\it foo }", which keeps braces balanced inside anchors.  See bug 38.
 
  2. Added a msgCountWithNew() sub to Messages.pm.  This can be used to get
     a little display of total and unread messages for an arbitrary object.
 
  3. Added messages to requests.  Changed requests to be generic objects, and
     they are now accessed through getObj().  Added the above message counter
     to the requests list screen.

  4. Lots of little changes in linking.  Removed __NL__ and __CR__, I think 
     whatever these were needed for is now deprecated.  See bug 40. 
  
Thu Mar  7 17:16:32 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0023

  1. Changed contextHighlight to fix a problem whereby the highlighting would
     break if two query terms were adjacent. 

  2. Changed encyclopedia object rendering proc (in GetObj) so that 
     the link to the pronunciation guide is inline with the top of the
     pronunciation section (to save space.)

  3. Added a danglinglinks script in bin/convert.  This script analyzes the
     reference links table and removes links which are to or from a
     nonexistant object.  We had about 800 such links.  I don't think that 
     any more will occur, since now all reference links are deleted when 
     re-linking an entry.

  4. Modified GetObj so that it detects unowned objects and doesn't try to do
     a join on the user table for them.

Thu Mar  7 13:01:16 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0022

  1. Imported all of PlanetMath that seemed relevant into a CVS repository
     on functor.  If you have an account on functor that is in the pm group,
     then the pm module is available under the /var/lib/cvs repository (for
     example, for remote access, set the variables CVS_RSH=ssh and
     CVSROOT=:ext:user@planetmath.org:/var/lib/cvs, then run "cvs co pm"; or
     on functor itself, simply set CVSROOT=/var/lib/cvs instead)

  2. lib/Planetmath.pm: now uses dbConnect instead of hard-coded connect

  3. {etc,lib}/pmconf.pm: made a really crude "base configuration" file.
     This is needed for installation-specific settings, and the file itself
     must be installation specific.  This is really tricky to get to work
     with Apache, mod_perl, cvs, and all that.  Currently lib/pmconf.pm is
     supposed to be just a symlink to etc/pmconf.pm, and only the symlink
     itself is stored in the repository.

  4. lib/Config.pm: some changes to use pmconf.pm; some config variables now
     refer to settings established by pmconf.pm (things dealing with paths
     and DB information so far)

  5. lib/DB.pm: the hostname is now specified explicitly in dbConnect

  6. lib/{Layout,Util}.pm: moved readFile from Layout.pm to Util.pm, where
     it belongs (the reason for its existence in Layout.pm is deprecated)

  7. etc/httpd-planetmath.conf: Moved all httpd configuration relevant to
     PM into this file.  This file should simply be included by the root
     httpd.conf (stole this notion from scoop).  This file should be copied
     into lib/httpd-planetmath.conf, and included from there.  The file in
     etc is stored in cvs and serves as an example or starting point.  The
     file in lib is what is installation specific, and should be what is
     included into httpd.conf.


Wed Mar  6 20:07:50 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0021

  1. Augmented the orphaning system slightly so it can recognize who the last
     owner of an object was, and avoid updating the grace interval when this
     same person adopts back their own object.  This is done by changing the 
     owner of an object to -(oldid), where oldid is the user id of the owner,
     at abandoning time.  All comparisons have been updated so that userid<=0
     is the true "unowned" criterion.  To check if we should update the grace
     interval at adoption time, we simply check if $curuserid=-$userid.  NOTE:
     We should probably change the "anonymous" user to be user zero everywhere
     in the code.  Currently, we have a user with id 1, and there could be some
     conflicts as -1 is the "nobody" user right now.

  2. Added an autoOrphan function and a call to it in the outstandingcor 
     script.  Now orphaning should happen automatically.


Mon Mar  4 05:15:39 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0020

  1. Made some minor additions to the (so far) undocumented orphanage and
     adoption system.

    a) Added function isAdoptable, to make the logic buried in the orphanage
       function accessible.

    b) Changed the adoptObject function so that it checks isAdoptable.  The
       implementation was that an object was only adoptable if it was
       unowned, but this contradicted the orphanage function, so I presumed
       the logic that is now in isAdoptable is acceptable to govern this.

    c) Implemented reset of graceint on pending corrections for an object
       when it is adopted (as described in Note 0019-3).

    d) Also added a check that prevents adopting objects you already own.
       However, nothing prevents you from abandoning and then adopting
       your own objects, so one can avoid responding to corrections
       indefinitely by this method (not sure if it's worth the trouble to
       prevent).

    e) Fixed logchange.pl (there are exactly 9 days a month where the day of
       the month has a single digit, you know :P).


Sun Mar  3 10:47:19 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0019

  1. (These changes are really all from yesterday) Implemented + and - (which
     I call "forcing" and "forbidding") functionality to the search engine.  
     This allows the user to require that a word appear in the "match set" for
     and entry, or allows the user to require that a word NOT appear.  The
     functionality appears to work completely. 

  2. Added a "self" field to the encyclopedia objects table. This should be set
     to "true" if the object contains its own proof.  Added code to the "show
     unproven theorems" functionality to check for this flag.  Added a control
     to the admin metadata editor to turn this flag on.  Added functionality
     to the update object metadata functions to handle checkboxes as booleans.
     Still need to add this to the normal object editor screen.

  3. Added an outstanding correction nag system.  Added a "nag_times" hash to
     the config describing when the various nag stages happen and how the 
     nagging recurs.  Added the "nag" table, which allows the system to 
     remember the time of last nag.  Added an outstandingcor script to the bin
     directory, which gets run every hour to process nags (and soon, orphaning
     objects automatically.)  Most of the nag functions are in Corrections.pm.
     Also added a "graceint" field to the corrections table.  This is a "grace
     interval", which is meant to be used if an object is adopted.  At such 
     time, it should be set to the difference between the current time and the
     time each correction was filed, so that the new owner may "start fresh".

Sat Mar  2 23:29:37 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0018

  1. Implemented the beginnings of a pronunciation guide system.  See
     Pronounce.pm.  Any pronunciation has associated with it an encoding.
     An encoding merely consists of a method to render it to html so that
     it has a human readable form.  In the future it will also be possible
     to denote mappings between encodings, so that, for instance, something
     simple like "jargon" encoding could be automatically translated to
     "IPA".


Thu Feb 28 13:02:59 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0017

  1. Created a function getUnprovenTheorems, which obtains the list of
     objects of type theorem that do not have objects of type proof attached
     to them.  Also created a page accessible by op=unproven, to generate
     this list and provide convenient "fill" links for interested parties.
     This should be linked from the main page somehow.


Thu Feb 28 12:32:24 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0016

  1. Missing an lc($word) in findmatches() in Crossref.pm, hence capitalized 
     words weren't getting matched in the terms hash, and hence no links to 
     capitalized objects were getting made.  Fixed this.  Wrote a script to 
     title invalidate (using xrefTitleInvalidate()) the portion of the corpus 
     this effects.  See bug 33.


Thu Feb 28 09:26:37 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0015

  1. User and admin corrections pages are now paged

  2. The list of another user's objects is now paged


Thu Feb 28 08:21:32 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0014

  1. Added a user preference named pagelength

  2. The getPageWidget function no longer takes a scalar as a second
     argument.  Instead, it must be given a reference to a user_info
     hash, so that it may determine the proper page length from the
     user preference added in (1).


Thu Feb 28 08:02:20 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0013

  1. New "logchange.pl" script in the bin dir, which I am currently using to
     edit this file.  Automatically generates the changelog entry header line,
     and puts you in the editor.  Handles "locking" on changelog file.

  2. Cleaned up some links table problems.  There were about 6 times as many
     entries in the tables as real links, due to an architecture flaw in how
     links are handled when objects are edited, and the fact that no checks
     for duplicate links were ever made.  This never hurt linking, but it was
     picked up when we wanted to get real link statistics.  Now I've added an
     xrefLinkPresent() function to check to see if a link exists before making
     it.  Also added some error checking to xrefAddLink() when I noticed the
     links table had links from objectid "-1".  Now there will be a warning
     produced whenever either of the object ids is <0, or either of the table
     names are blank.


Thu Feb 28 05:12:37 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0012

  1. Fixed missing $template->expand() in Books.pm in order to close bug 29.
 
  2. Created new FileCache object (documented in docs/filecache.txt)

  3. Changed Template.pm to use FileCaches

  4. Created adminstats.html stemplate and added an op that provides an
     admin stats page.  Currently the only thing there is a count of file
     cache hits and invalidations.  May be useful for future stuff.

  5. Fixed a typo in dispmessages.html (bug 31)

  6. Moved escaping of .*algorithm environments to before inline-math
     escaping in Crossref.pm, as Lalgorithm environments almost always
     contain inlined math.  Fixes bug 30.

  7. Implemented display of object owners in search output.  I don't know
     if it should stay the way I did it.


Wed Feb 27 12:28:05 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0011

  1. Revamped the code to take advantage of the new system introduced in
     Note 0009-2.  This required tons of minor changes, and the semantics
     of some functions have changed.  For instance, all of the functions
     called by getObj to generate html now return template objects instead
     of text.  Similar changes abound.


Wed Feb 27 12:23:40 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0010

  1. Put in a "defines" display for search results.  This is important 
     because concepts people will be searching for may not appear as bona-
     fide titles.
  
  2. Made metadata headers ("From", "Classification", "Defines") appear 
     underlined in search results. 

  3. Put in context highlighting of search results.  This means that results
     have query terms bolded, and extra junk between occurances is limited
     in length and replaced with "..." in the middle.  New function is 
     contextHighlight() in Search.pm.  Also this took over some of the former
     functionality of getEncyclopediaResultText(), so that function is 
     modified.

  4. "Defines" now has a red asterisk in front of it if there are "hits" in
     the defines field, which should help draw the user's attention to them
     to help them find the concept they were looking for, assuming it appears
     in the "Defines" field.  This works by simply comparing the text for the
     field pre- and post-contextHighlight. 

Wed Feb 27 05:53:25 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu> Note 0009

  1. Modified htmlescape to add escaping of & before escaping of < and >.

  2. Bug 26 illustrated a few problems with the current template system,
     which lead me to discover a few more problems (about which I won't go
     into detail here).  So I've implemented a new template system, which
     consists of all of the code in Template.pm.  The rest of the code has
     not been moved over to use this new system yet, so everything else has
     remained pretty much untouched.  This new interface should (will?) be
     documented somewhere shortly.

Tue Feb 26 22:46:30 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0008

  1. Made the handling of tags/quotes around words in the cross-referencing 
     much simpler.  See notag(), getstarttag(), getendtag().  Also removed 
     code from splitLaTeX() that inserted extra spaces to try to isolate 
     "words" (away from punctuation), as this is no longer necessary. See 
     bug 25.

Tue Feb 26 13:41:23 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0007

  1. There was a bug in getRequestUpdater which was keeping the new "update" 
     link from resulting in an updater screen with the proper request already
     selected.  The line

     my $requested=$options->{$request};

     was wrong, since this gets the title of the request, and the select box
     is initialized by the hash key (which is the id).

  2. Updated DelObj.pm so the generic object delete behavior is to delete a
     row in the $params->{from} table with the right id, and then to do the 
     standard stuff.  A stub had been left in which kept everything but 
     encyclopedia objects from actually getting deleted.

  3. Added deleteFileBox() to Filebox.pm, so that fileboxes get cleaned out 
     upon deleting.

  4. Changed some parameter checks from "defined" to nb() in 
     handleFileManager().  $params->{tempdir} was getting set to "" versus 
     undef, so by the second call, handleFileManager thought it was editing in 
     a temp dir.  This fixes bug 22.

  1. Moved handling of \PMlinkescapeword and \PMlinkescapephrase to a new
     sub in Crossref.pm called getEscapedWords, which is called in makelinks().
     This shifts the implementation of these pseudo-commands from an a-priori
     substring removal of the desired string from the latex to an a-posteriori
     check on the titles on which links were produced for the entry.  The old
     behavior would also kill linking of "mean value theorem" if the user 
     requested \PMlinkescapeword{mean} (bug 12).  This is no longer a problem.

  2. Actually got the synonym and defines link suppression to work. Had to 
     make changes to generateterms() and makelinks() mostly.

  3. Grabbag of other fixes related to deleting objects (unindexing was not 
     happening or was erroneous).  Most changes in DelObj.pm.  See bugs 14+19.
 
  4. Actually made "defines" field get updated in database in EditObj.pm. See
     bug 21.

  1. Increased main_memory in /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf by a factor of 10.  For
     some reason using curved lines in this particular xypic figure required
     more memory.  Why this was not a problem with my automata diagrams, I do
     not know.  Note that to change texmf.cnf, after you save the file, you
     must run fmtutil --all for changes to take effect.

  2. Commented out assignments to $desc in getObj.  I believe this fixes the
     problem of user-preferences being ignored in regards to message order,
     and that this parameter to getMessages is deprecated.

  3. Modified getSelectBox so that it sorts the keys of the hash it is given
     before generating the selectbox.

  4. Added getSelectBoxSortByValue, a variant of getSelectBox that sorts by
     the values in the hash instead of the keys.

  5. Added "update" link next to "fill" link on each request.  The update
     form can now set the requested request as the default item in the
     request select box if specified, and this new update link takes
     advantage of that.  The request selectbox is now generated by
     getSelectBoxSortByValue as well.

  6. Added humanReadableCmp, which is meant to define a more human readable
     ordering on strings.  Currently it is crude -- strings with
     non-alphabetic leading characters sort ahead of anything else, and
     the rest is simply a case-insensitive lexicographic sort.  It also
     strips things like quotes first, and collapses spaces.

  7. Modified the editcors op so that it takes a global parameter.
     This parameter only has effect for admins and, if defined lists all
     objects with pending corrects (as opposed to the list of all
     corrections for the current user that it typically displays).


Mon Feb 25 14:22:49 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu> Note 0004

  1. Changed $MATH_SCALE_FACTOR back to 1.6.  There were some occurances of
     very ugly rendering with the smaller scale factor.  If you dont believe
     me, try setting the scale factor back to 1.5 and rerendering the 
     "self-dual" entry.  Look at the \rightarrows and equal signs in 
     particular, parts of them nearly dissapear.  Other symbols are bad too.

  2. Completely changed the synonym handling system and generalized it to 
     handle a "defines" field.  This involved:

     * Creating a new table, objindex, which serves as a "title" index for
       any object on planetmath.  This includes defines, synonyms, and 
       actual "master" titles for an entry.  The different types are 
       differentiated by 1 for master, 2 for synonym, and 3 for defines.

     * Changing the encyclopedia index to query the above table instead of
       the encyclopedia table (objects) itself. 

     * Changing createSynonyms and deleteSynonyms to use the new schema.

     * Changing getEncyclopediaExtras to display "defines" if there are any.

     * Changing the encyclopedia entry "add" and edit forms for handling 
       the "defines" field, as well as the support functions for these forms.

     * Creating an "indexTitle" in Indexing.pm which maintains the objindex
       record for the title for an object, and calling this from object 
       adding/updating locations (in Encyclopedia.pm and EditObj.pm.)

     Synonym/defines "surrogates" are still stored with each object's record,
     in "defines" and "synonym" fields.

  3. Updated the reference linking system to make use of the "defines" field.
     I thought this was going to be simple, but I ran into a little crisis at
     what should have been 3/4 of the way through implementing it.  The problem
     was that the mapping of a unique "concept" to an actual entry, and making
     sure that a link to that "concept" doesn't happen twice in the same entry,
     and that the first occurance of the "concept" is the only one that gets 
     linked, was going to be basically impossible the way things were done 
     before.  To fix this, I had to actually change the generateterms() 
     function to generate what I call a "concept id" for entries that are 
     truly unique concepts, and put them in a hash so that the object ids they
     refer to can be looked up.  So basically, the deciding factor for whether
     a term gets a new concept id is whether its type is either 1 (master 
     title entry) or 3 (defines entry.)  A concept id => object id hash is 
     built from these entries first, and then a reverse-lookup is done for all
     the synonyms and they are given concept ids that have already been
     generated.  

     The rest of the changes are in makelinks(), where unique "concepts" are 
     the final determining factor for whether a link is "unique."

     Note: There is a problem on the horizon.  We're going to have to take 
     care of the situation where someone needs to define synonyms for a 
     *defines* item in an object.  I guess we need an "advanced" synonyms 
     field where the user can enter things like
      
                defines1 = defines1.synonym1
                defines1 = defines1.synonym2
                defines2 = defines1.synonym2
                  ...    =      ...
                
     and then toss these mappings into objlinks as syonym types.
     
     Note: Much linking may be broken at this point, but I tried a couple 
     entries and they seem fine.

     Note: Why does vim syntax highlight "may" in changelogs??

  1. Modified splitLaTeX so that quoted dollar signs are more appropriately
     handled (I can imagine certain cases that are still broken, e.g.,
     $sequential$$math$$with$$no$$spaces$, but that's just dumb anyway)


Mon Feb 25 06:56:46 UTC 2002  Aaron Krowne <akrowne@vt.edu>  Note 0002

  1. Modified correction closing so that, if the closer doesn't modify the
     correction text which gets copied into the closing comment, the comment
     is set to "" (keeps it from appearing twice in the closing email.)


Mon Feb 25 05:11:22 UTC 2002  Logan Hanks <logan@vt.edu>  Note 0001

  1. Modified the system's latex2html script so that it forces \verb and
     \verb* to always be \verb (as opposed to forcing them to always be
     \verb*)
  2. Added a cookie that does not explicitly set the domain attribute; the
     cookie that does explicitly set that attribute is probably superfluous
  3. Added javascript autofocus on the term field of the search form
  4. Spawned a ChangeLog
  5. Modified getSelectBox to take an additional, optional parameter attrs,
     which is a string that is added to the generated <select> tag
  6. Added javascript autosubmit on the view style select box in GetObj.pm
