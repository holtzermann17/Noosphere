(scroll to bottom for DONE items)

============================= Documentation Items ============================

* ACL and multiple editing guide.
  
  (Wed May 22 02:38:17 UTC 2002, apk)

* PlanetMath style guide
  Note: this has been started, we are going to do this as a collaborative 
  document.

  (Wed May 22 02:38:17 UTC 2002, apk)

* PlanetMath-centric intro to LaTeX.  Maybe not separate from style guide?

  (Wed May 22 02:38:17 UTC 2002, apk)

========================== Layout and interface items =======================

* Pseudo-html user comments (like k5)

  (Sun May  5 03:14:00 EDT 2002, lbh)

* Add ability to change how things are sorted.  It'd be nice to have a
  generalized sorting widget.  To start with, we want this on the "your objects"  page.

  (Fri Apr  5 07:25:01 UTC 2002, apk)

* Finish conversion from HTML to XSL templates.

  (Fri Feb  6 05:51:58 UTC 2004, apk)

* We currently have routines to print out the "long form" of a classification,
  human-readably.  What we need is a short form, perhaps one that just uses 
  the top-level MSC.  This would be done by looking at the first (ord=0) 
  classification for an object.  These need to then be printed on the search
  results screen, and in the encyclopedia alphabetical listing.

  (Thu Feb 28 12:53:14 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* A generalized paging routine.  It should take an SQL query, a function,
  and the params and user_info hashes, run the query with appropriate offset
  and limit, call the given function on each row, and output the result with
  page controls.

  (Thu Feb 28 09:39:50 UTC 2002, lbh)

============================ Infrastructural items ===========================

* Allow collaboration objects to serve as "site documentation".  The first 
  component of this is the (existing) collaboration system.  The second is 
  data marking certain objects as site documentation (a flag).   The third is
  some demarcation of collaboration objects as site documentation.  The fourth
  is a site documentation section which lists these objects.  And the fifth 
  would be a system whereby a user can request a collaboration object become
  site documentation, and/or an admin can grant this status.

  Note: Items one through three are already done.

  (Fri Feb  6 05:51:58 UTC 2004, apk)

* Need a link policy system, so that users can control bad automatic linking
  behavior from the source, rather than only by manual link controls at every
  occurrence.  The policy would mostly allow/forbid linking to/from particular
  subject areas, denoted in terms of MSC.

  More info, including a proposed link policy syntax, can be found in the 
  PlanetMath thesis.

  Note: this system is the first "half" of an overlinking prevention system.
  
  (Fri Feb  6 05:51:58 UTC 2004, apk)

* Need a bad link reporting system.  this system should be usable by logged in 
  or non-logged-in users to get the maximum amount of attention.  The user 
  should be able to click on "report bad links" on the bottom of the page, at 
  which point they are taken to a screen listing the links in the entry.  They
  should be able to request to "zap" links entirely, or select a better 
  alternative from a set of linking possibilities (as in for homonyms).  These 
  actions then result in confirmation-notices sent to the entry author before 
  any actual action is taken.

  This system is the other "half" of an overlinking prevention system, the
  first half of which is the previous TODO item.

  (Sun May 19 03:11:31 UTC 2002, apk)

* Implement a title index daemon, which holds the index in-memory.  The auto-
  linker would talk to this daemon over a socket, sending it a list of words
  and getting a back list of arrays holding entry information for first-word
  matches.  This will enable us to stop generating a first-word term
  hash from the entire corpus each time linking is done. The fact that this is
  done each time really makes the linking O(n), where n is the number of entries
  in the encyclopedia.  With the daemon keeping a hash in-memory, the linking
  will be O(m), with m the number of words in the entry, as it should be.

  (Wed Mar  6 20:49:35 UTC 2002, apk)

* A better LaTeX parser.

  Note: Possibly integrate LaTeX:TOM (by apk).

  (Fri Feb  6 05:51:58 UTC 2004, apk)
  (Sun May  5 03:14:00 EDT 2002, lbh)

* Need a link abstraction system. instead of links being URLs to the actual 
  destination entry, links should go to a planetmath subroutine that can 
  determine the destination based upon a variety of factors, and redirect the 
  user to the best one.

  UPDATE, apk: is this really so useful?

  (Sun May 19 03:11:31 UTC 2002, apk)

* Think of a way to do disambiguation across MSC areas.  For instance, "domain"
  is usually used in the function sense (MSC 03), yet it will be invoked in 
  other MSC areas.  In this case, the linking behavior becomes random.  What 
  is needed is a way to link to a most popular, or most basic sense.  Perhaps
  we could just make 03 the the "default", or order the areas by how elementary
  they are.  Solutions where we don't have to input more data, though, are 
  preferable.

  (Fri Apr  5 07:25:01 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* Rework the query repair system.  Note that it will never be invoked if as
  few as two words are searched for and one is misspelled, but the second 
  has occurrences.  What should happen is that the query is /always/ checked 
  for misspellings.  If there are any, there are two possible behaviors: (1) 
  repair the query and issue it in the background.   If there are more results
  than for the uncorrected query, suggest to the user the repaired query 
  (perhaps cache the results somehow so the search doesn't have to be 
  deployed again). (2) always suggest the repaired query (this might get 
  annoying, depending on how big the lexicon is).   

  Problems with (2) could be combatted by never suggesting corrections for 
  words which exist in the corpus somewhere.

  (Sun Jan 12 20:27:30 EST 2003 by apk)

* Implement search result weighting based on # of links pointing to an entry.
  This should help get the most "basic", "important" entries to the top.  

  Note: this requires a link-analysis search engine, so is a big item.  

  (Wed Mar  6 20:49:35 UTC 2002, apk)

* Be smarter about changes in synonyms and defines fields.  Currently we just
  re-construct the defines and synonyms every time there's an edit, which 
  involves title invalidating each of them.  This can lead to tens or hundreds
  of spurious invalidations.
  
  (Sat Mar  2 01:06:42 UTC 2002, apk)

* Keep "related" link information in the links table.  Generalize links table.
  Display related as well as content links in the "references to" page.

  (Fri Mar  1 01:06:30 UTC 2002, apk)

* A synonym system for "defines" entries.  This requires further generalization
  of the schema for titles/synonyms/defines and their mappings to concepts.  
  Concept IDs should actually be stored in the database instead of calculated
  on-the-fly in the linking system.  One neat thing this will enable is a count
  of discrete "concepts" in the encyclopedia, which is significantly greater
  than the number of entries. 

  (Tue Feb 26 19:37:11 UTC 2002, apk)

============================= Data provider items: ==========================

* More complete source metadata format for the Open Archive.

  (Tue Apr  1 23:02:02 UTC 2003, apk)

* Download of ps/pdf of entries.

  (Fri Feb  6 05:51:58 UTC 2004, apk)

* "Print view" of entries.

  (Fri Feb  6 05:51:58 UTC 2004, apk)

* Enrich offline browsable snapshots so they contain correction information, 
  and contributors who only filed corrections.

  (Fri Feb  6 05:51:58 UTC 2004, apk)

=============================================================================
                                     DONE
=============================================================================

* Integrate a faster, newer search engine (i.e., ESSEX).

  (Done: late 2003, apk)
  (Tue Apr  1 23:02:02 UTC 2003, apk)

* Some handling of theorems that contain their own proofs (perhaps a flag).
  NOTE: this is now partially implemented; we still need to put the flag on the 
  user object editing screen.

  (Done: sometime in mid 2003, apk)
  (Thu Feb 28 12:53:14 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* IMPORTANT: We're out of space for "also defines" and "synonym" fields.  These
  should be changed to a text field.

  (Done: Fri Jun  7 10:31:40 UTC 2002  apk)
  (Fri Apr  5 07:25:01 UTC 2002, apk)

* "random entry" link in features.  This would take the user to a random 
  encyclopedia entry. (maybe better placed on the encyclopedia index page)

  (Done: Sun Jan 12 22:16:25 EST 2003)
  (Thu Mar  7 01:51:17 UTC 2002, apk)

* Fix the quoting functionality (for messages).  This is pretty badly broken.

  (Done: ?, apk)
  (Sun Mar  3 13:06:32 UTC 2002, apk)

* A link to view the preamble for an entry (or perhaps add this to the source
  view.)

  (Done: Sat Jun 15 22:36:28 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Sat Mar  2 18:46:44 UTC 2002, apk)

* Need a confirmation-notice system. this system should allow the deferred 
  performance of various actions (like accepting a symmetric "related" link) 
  until the user selects from a set of possible options (i.e. "yes" or "no").  
  This could concievably take the form of an augmentation to the notices 
  system.

  (Done: Fri Jul 26 16:19:51 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Sun May 19 03:11:31 UTC 2002, apk)

* Logging for object modifications.  This includes diffs of all changes to 
  the text body.  We can scrap the current version system and just let people
  view diff histories (current system is a big hack and makes the schema ugly.)

  IMPORTANT: we need logging now, for object owner history (As in adoption.)

  (Wed May 29 17:28:29 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Tue Feb 26 19:37:11 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* Set up an Open Archives interface.  Come up with some PlanetMath schemas 
  and/or crosswalks to standard schemas.  We should have at least Dublin
  Core for the OAI interface.

  (Done, Fri May 24 12:27:03 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Wed May 22 02:38:17 UTC 2002, apk)

* Need a generalized way of listing, on the user info page, all of the objects
  (corrections and otherwise) a user has authored.

  (Done, Fri May 24 12:27:03 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Mon Apr 15 20:55:29 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* Paging on the user list page.

  (Done, Fri May 10 22:58:09 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Wed Apr 17 01:06:08 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* Finish putting in more types (result, conjecture, example...).  

  (Done, Wed Apr 17 01:06:08 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Tue Feb 26 19:37:11 UTC 2002, apk)

* classification nag for new entries.  This can be done smartly: that is, only
  when there is an identical title in the system.  Perhaps we should force
  classification when this is the case: this would make the linking entirely
  predictable, and never ambiguous.

  Note: this was implemented as a warning-- it shows up for all editing, not
  just new entries.
  
  (Done: Wed Apr 17 01:06:08 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Sat Mar  2 01:30:48 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* Generalized object watch widget (steal from encyclopedia objects).  Place on
  all objects (news, requests, polls...).

  (Done: Mon Apr 15 14:51:55 UTC 2002, apk) (actually done yesterday)
  (Fri Mar  8 14:43:41 UTC 2002, apk)

* Discussions for corrections.  This won't be hard to put in.

  (Done: Mon Apr 15 14:51:55 UTC 2002, apk) (actually done yesterday)
  (Fri Apr 12 16:24:03 UTC 2002, apk)

* note that the pseudo-LaTeX PM commands can only take plain text contents (no
  LaTeX commands)

  (Done: Sun Apr  7 16:00:24 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Thu Mar  7 17:24:00 UTC 2002, apk)

* make a cron job to clean out the cache/temp dir.  This should remove 
  directories that are a day old or so.

  (Done: Sun Apr  7 15:52:35 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Thu Mar  7 18:16:00 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* Some dictionary functionality.  For example: pronunciation (and some
  consensus on how to specify it, there may be existing standards); wav
  files as examples of pronunciation; formal specification of accepted
  usage (e.g., plural forms, etc.); specification of how a term functions
  (e.g. noun, adjective, verb, etc.); and maybe more.  Most of these are
  simply additional text associated with an object (and additional form
  controls for adding/editing them), but some sort of stylistic conventions
  for each would also be needed.

  (Done: Sat Mar  2 23:29:37 UTC 2002, lbh)
  (Sat Mar  2 18:50:51 UTC 2002, lbh)

* IMPORTANT: Let's get some LaTeX error reporting.  In fact, we should have
  some generalized method of reporting errors back from rendering front-ends.

  (Done: Sun Apr  7 15:12:49 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Fri Mar 22 04:11:43 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* Object orphaning and adopting.  It will be nice to have the above logging 
  so that it preserves a history of how objects have changed hands. 

  NOTE: the logging portion still needs to be done... but we can roll this 
  into generic logging for all changes.

  (Fri Mar 22 04:11:43 UTC 2002, apk) (actually done around March 6)
  (Tue Feb 26 19:37:11 UTC 2002, apk)

* See about coding up an actual inverted index for the search engine (current
  system stores the information in the database, so we've got O(log n) lookups
  instead of the O(1) we'd get from an inverted index + a hash for the 
  dictionary word -> id mapping.)

  (Done: Tue Mar 19 20:07:07 UTC 2002, apk) (actually done a while ago)
  (Tue Feb 26 19:37:11 UTC 2002, apk)

* Research and implement a system for query spell correct.  Perhaps this should
  be done using n-grams and a circular (permuted) index?  What about the query
  lexicon?  Should we generate this from the text, or from commonly misspelled
  query terms?

  NOTE: Implemented using n-gram index for coarse search and Levenshtein (edit)
  distance for the precise search.  The system works best for single-word
  queries which are misspelled, but exist in the lexicon.  The lexicon was 
  formed from the MSC, and all of the titles in the encyclopedia.

  (Done: Tue Mar 19 20:07:07 UTC 2002, apk) (actually done week of march 6)
  (Wed Mar  6 20:49:35 UTC 2002, apk)
  
* Allow discussion under request objects.  This would be extremely useful.

* User preference for page sizes for various screens (esp "Your Objects").

  (Done: Thu Feb 28 08:31:21 UTC 2002, lbh)
  (Tue Feb 26 19:37:11 UTC 2002, apk)

* Revise template system, and change all of PM to use it

  (Done: Wed Feb 27 12:44:40 UTC 2002, lbh)
  (Wed Feb 27 05:59:41 UTC 2002, lbh)

* Pull out context of search words and bold them in search results text.

  (Done: Wed Feb 27 12:31:52 UTC 2002, apk)
  (Tue Feb 26 19:37:11 UTC 2002, apk)

* Add a list of "defines" (and maybe synonyms) to search results items for
  encyclopedia objects, and highlight search terms in them. This will enable 
  the user to more easily see that a result with a different title is actually
  relevant to their search.
