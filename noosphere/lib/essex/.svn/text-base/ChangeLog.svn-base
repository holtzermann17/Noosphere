2003-06-25 apk : 
 - This was actually done a few weeks ago, but I fixed rankings in ESSEX.  
   Previously, they had been normalized improperly.

2003-06-01 apk :
 - The RELAX_POSTINGS flag in the config should work now.  This allows 
   changing the posting list data structure so that 4 billion documents are 
   allowed instead of 16.7 million, 256 term frequency levels instead of 16, 
   and 256 fields instead of 16.

   Clean recompilation may be needed to get this to work.

2003-05-16 apk :
 - Now only the first time a field weight for a specific field in a query is   
   encountered will the weight be accepted.  This allows a digital library 
   client to always append some default weights, but when a user specifies 
   other weights, they will come first and take precedent.
 
2003-05-15 apk :
 - Added sample usage perl code.

2003-04-26 apk :
 - Fixed daemon death upon client connection drop.  This should alleviate 
   random daemon dissapearance that was being observed.

2003-04-21 apk :
 - Renamed from "MOSES" to "ESSEX".  
 - Added field weight support. 
 - Cleaned up some security issues: it is no longer possible to "spam" the
   system with spurious terms or words (causing its dictionaries to grow).
 - Now if you start up ESSEX as root it will try to lock memory; regardless of
   the user it is set to run as.
