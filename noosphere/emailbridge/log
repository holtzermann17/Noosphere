i'm not sure whether the rating system presently incorporates the
trust metric (user reputation), but it easily could. it seems self
evident that a user's rating vote should be weighted by their
reputation. this would be a trivial change if it is not implemented
that way now.

is it?

a user's reputation should start out being zero. a positive reputation
must be earned. this guarantees that cranks cannot reinforce each
other. the system must be seeded by assigning a positive reputation
to, e.g., the founder(s), admins, and 'known' people..... with this in
place, a user's contributions can be used to create his rating and
vice-versa. i'm pretty sure this would be a convergent iterative
system, similar in principle to chess ratings, which are generally
agreed to be accurate.

perhaps we need to dumb down the rating system (or add a dumbed down
rating system alongside the current one). i recognize that the current
system is thoughtfully designed and gives precise feedback, but i
think more people would rate articles if it were a simple matter of
"was this article useful? (y/n)" or even "did you like it? (y/n)", and
i think the resulting rating would still be a useful approximation of
the article's overall quality. more precise feedback could be
communicated via comments.


>Marie is an easily bannable crank even for the current planetmath admins. She (I >assume by the name) is an obvious crank, easily recognizable from several miles >away. She should have been banned long time ago.

and yet many people have attempted to give serious feedback to marie
despite that she is an obvious crank, which i think speaks to the
helpful and inclusive nature of the community. i like that. perhaps
the way to deal with the maries of the world is not to ban or exclude
them but find an appropriate place for them within the community, and
i think there is one (see below).

> It is obviously nonsensical to allow any random person to come in and "squat" an entry.  I suppose even wikipedia is therefore more resistant to cranks and that's saying a lot.

this might be PM's chance to further distinguish itself from wikipedia
and mathworld, although in a potentially good way... not by inviting
more cranks, but, as others have suggested, creating different areas
for different purposes: at the very least, the encyclopedia, which is
regulated, and some kind of unpoliced public area (let me call it the
sandbox) where anyone may contribute anything. then, anyone coming to
the site to search the 'pedia will not even see the other stuff; PM
reputation problem solved! and at the same time, those who want to
submit rough articles for feedback, or just pinch their loaves of
unappreciated genius all over the ground, can do so without incurring
wrath.

some of these articles could eventually graduate from the sandbox to
the encyclopedia, and some may sit there forever, like so many rusty,
half buried toys, harming no one.



all this requires work and time and willingness. i for one am willing
to contribute a certain amount to a fund for the implementation of
these ideas (especially the improvement of the rating/reputation
system so that it is meaningful and people actually use it). i would
also be willing to do some coding if time permits.
