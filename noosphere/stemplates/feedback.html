There are plenty of ways to reach the <NS:template sitename/> Team:
<p>
<ul>
<li> You can use the "<NS:template sitename/> Comments" Forum, in the "Forums" section, and post a message.
<p>
<li>You can send us an e-mail message at <a href="mailto:<NS:template feedbacksiteaddr query/>"><NS:template feedbacksiteaddr/></a>.  <b>Please do not send questions of a mathematical nature here!</b> Use the forums instead.  The administrator(s) do not have the time, and more often than not, the ability to answer your math questions.

<p>
<li>You can speak with us real-time on IRC. Currently we are set up on a little-known network called <b>Endernet</b>, in <b>#planetmath</b>.  You can use pdox.endernet.org, br.endernet.org, dominia.endernet.org, or just irc.endernet.org.  Just ask your question and someone should be able to help you out.  
</ul>
<p>
Please use the above for comments and criticism about <NS:template sitename/> itself.  We are especially interested in hearing about ideas for improving <NS:template sitename/> and making it more usable to you and your community.
<p>
<b>However...</b> before you contact us, heed the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>If you have found an error in an entry</b>, please <a href="http://planetmath.org/?op=newuser">make an account</a> and file a correction (by going to the entry and clicking "correct").  The <NS:template sitename/> development team does <b>not</b> write the encyclopedia entries! </li>

<p>
<li>
<b>If you have a bug to report</b>, please use our <a href="http://bugs.planetmath.org">bugzilla system</a> to enter it in.  This makes it much more likely that the bug will eventually get fixed. </li>

<p>
<li>
<b>If you have a question about the nature of <NS:template sitename/></b>, or how to use it, please 
first <a href="http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=collab&id=35">read our FAQ</a> and perhaps browse the rest of our <a href="http://planetmath.org/?op=sitedoc">documentation</a>.  </li>

<p>
<li>We reiterate: <b>do not contact the admin(s) with mathematics questions!</b> Please utilize the community by posting a message to the entry of concern, posting a correction, or posting to the general forums.  Making your discourse public also allows others to benefit.
</li>
</ul>

Thanks! We hope to hear from you soon.
