<p>
A standard template will be applied to your submission, giving you the AMS math package.  All you need to do is give us everything between \begin{document} and \end{document}.  The template looks like:
<p>

<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<td bgcolor="#eeeeee">
<pre>
<NS:template template raw/>
</pre>
</td>
</table>
<p>
"$math" is replaced with your submission.  
<p>
"$packages" is currently replaced \usepackage{html} if html commands (needed for reference linking) are within your entry. 
<p>
"$preamble" is where the preamble you create is inserted.
<p>
If you have any ideas for improvement regarding math templates, please give us some <a href="<NS:template main_url/>/?op=feedback">feedback</a>.
