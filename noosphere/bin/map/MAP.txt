	*** MAP
The map source is a development blunder and somewhat godawful in a logistical
sense. It attempts to take an input tex file and parse it to generate a png
from which it will draw information to create a html style image map for use
with the output of the origional input tex file.


	*** COMPILATION
The source code has a make file, and can be compiled with the command "make" or
"make MAP". There are currently no makefile provisions for installation.


	*** SYNTAX
"{$BASE_DIR_TO_MAP_EXECUTABLE}/MAP <input file base name>" or
	"MAP <input file base name>"
if MAP has been placed in the $PATH. Input should be a tex file without the
".tex" at the end. Due to the "latex" execl call within the program, execuation
should occur in the base directory of the input document.


	*** PROPER USE
The MAP program assumes that the same programs (issuing the same command line
options) are being used to generate the image to be mapped, as the programms
being used to create the image for mapping. To see the commands used by MAP look
in the PRE-MAP.c file in the file_create() function.

GLAS-NOTE: The programs, commands, and command line options I used were taken
directly from the perl script provided to me, which is why they should work with
images generated for your site.


	*** UPDATES
08-25-2003 JEI
Underlining method changed. MAP now outputs commands that make LaTeX use
	ulem.sty instead of soul.sty because of some wierd things it broke.
	It cause erronious errors regarding broken fragile commands. 
Also, previously added support for LaTeX files containing multiple
	pages. MAP now outputs .map files with the format:
		[BASE NAME][TWO DIGIT PAGE NUMBER].map
	E.G.:
		TerseMathDocument02.map
	
01-14-2003 JEI
Contiguous underline now implemented using soul. However to keep soul from
	hyphenating words in a phrase that are at the documents edge, each
	member of an underlined phrase is enclosed in an \mbox{}.

01-13-2003 JEI
Added output of second tex file with *-HI.tex filename with highlited and
	underlined regions in place of \htmladdnormallink{} tags.
Added multiple latex runs to compensate for \ref{},  \eqref{}, and \cite{} tags.
	Only applied to files in which those tags are found.
Still no contiguous underlines or underbars of any sort. as they will cause text
	on the edge of a document to stretch page width.
