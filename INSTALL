General critique:

When it says "Of course, the directories will all need to
be changed to conform to your own $NSROOT." really I think
that implies that all of the files should be rewritten in
one fell swoop by a configuration tool.  But as it stands,
$NSROOT should be /var/www/ anyway, or things aren't going
to be so pretty.

Noosphere Installation Guide 
                            
============================

This guide was last updated on May 14, 2010.  Things
mostly worked, but more details are coming.

Section 1 : Prerequisites 
=========================

 You'll need the following programs and modules to run Noosphere (Debian 
 packages given in parens, for those who run Debian, if available):

 - PostgreSQL (postgresql, postgresql-client) or 
   MySQL (mysql-client, mysql-common, mysql-server)
 - Apache (apache2, apache2.2-common)
 - mod_perl (optional, but recommended) (libapache2-mod-perl2)
 - perl 5.8 or better (perl)
 - generic Apache request library (libapreq2, libapreq2-dev)
 - APR Perl modules (libapache2-request-perl)
 - XSLT command line processor (xsltproc)
 - and the following perl modules:
     * DBI (libdbi-perl)
     * DBI postgresql driver (libdbd-pg-perl) or
	   DBI mysql driver (libdbd-mysql-perl)
     * Apache (**comes with libapache2-mod-perl2)
     * XML::LibXML (libxml-libxml-perl)
     * XML::LibXSLT (libxml-libxslt-perl)
     * XML::DOM (libxml-dom-perl)
     * Unicode::String (libunicode-string-perl)
     * Digest::SHA1 (libdigest-sha1-perl) 
     * Data::Denter (libyaml-perl)
     * XML::Writer (libxml-writer-perl)
     * XML::Simple (libxml-simple-perl)
     * MIME::Lite (libmime-lite-perl)
     * [... there are more ...]

 - wget (wget)

 - Tidy (Ubuntu version doesn't work)
   wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/P/PE/PETDANCE/HTML-Tidy-1.08.tar.gz
   perl Makefile.PL 
   make
   make install

 - vim 6.0 or better (vim)

   NOTE: This is for the syntax-highlighted source view.
   Vim is only run in batch mode, this is not an attempt
   to switch EMACS-freaks over to the "dark side" !!

 - ispell (ispell)

     * a dictionary such as American English (iamerican)

 - ghostscript (gs or gs-aladdin)
 - pbm utils (netpbm)
 - LaTeX2e (tetex-base, tetex-bin)
 - ImageMagick (libs and dev) (libmagickcore2, libmagickcore-dev)
 - latex2html release 2002-2 (latex2html, in multiverse;
   you'll fetch this with 'apt-get source latex2html' so you
   can patch it; see instructions below!)

Section 2 : Installation Procedure
==================================

 1. Install the prerequisites (except latex2html, unless you've already got it,
    in which case you should upgrade if its not 2002-2)
      
 2. Go to the directory above where you want Noosphere to live.  Untar 
    the Noosphere archive:
	
     tar -zxvf noosphere-VERSION.tar.gz

    You may want to move or symlink the created directory to just "noosphere"
    or something like "nsdir".  This directory will henceforth be referred to as 
    $NSROOT -- for convenience you can of course set this in your shell with
      export NSROOT=/path/to/nsdir
     
 3. Create a database and database user for Noosphere.  These can be named  
    however you like, since you will just configure them later for Noosphere,
    but for this installation guide we will refer to them as $NSDB and $NSUSER.
    E.g. you can use commands like this:

    mysql -u root -p

    create database noosphere;

    grant all privileges on noosphere.* to 'noosphere'@'localhost' identified by 'make_up_a_clever_password';

 3a. You're going to have to set up a database for your
     project as well?  Oh, wait, maybe not.

    mysql -u root -p

    create database noosphere;

    grant all privileges on pc.* to 'pc'@'localhost' identified by 'make_up_a_clever_password';
    

 4a. Initialize the database for Noosphere:

     cd $NSROOT/db
     psql -W -U $NSUSER $NSDB < schema.pg.sql 
	 
	  or
	  
     mysql -u $NSUSER -p $NSDB < schema.mysql.sql

    You also need to get some start-up data into the system; in particular a
    root user and some forums.  Edit $NSROOT/db/init.sql to your 
    liking, and then issue

     psql -W -U $NSUSER $NSDB < init.sql

	  or 

     mysql -u $NSUSER -p $NSDB < init.sql

 4b. Load MSC (Mathematics Subject Classification scheme)
     category data if you will have classification support
     turned on and want this scheme.  Issue a command like
     the one above for your DBMS, but for msc.sql.

 5a. apt-get source latex2html downloads several files to
     the directory where you run it; to keep things neat,
     you may want to
       cd $NSROOT && mkdir latex2html && cd latex2html
     before you fetch the sources.

     Then switch to $NSROOT/latex2html/latex2html-2002-2-1-20050114
     and run

      ./configure --with-gs=$NSROOT/bin/gs

 5b. Make the latex2html programs:

      make

 5c. Install latex2html (this step is not strictly necessary):

      make install

 5d. Patch latex2html for Noosphere [some hunks may fail...]:

     patch latex2html < $NSROOT/install/patch-latex2html-2002-2

     Also patch some other l2h modules:

     patch -p0 < $NSROOT/install/patch-latex2html-2002-2-math.pl
     patch /usr/local/share/lib/latex2html/styles/babel.perl < $NSROOT/install/patch-latex2html-2002-2-styles

 5e. Install patched latex2html locally for Noosphere:

     cp latex2html $NSROOT/bin

 5f. For Russian support patch latex2html style files [I'm ignoring this for now]:

     cd $L2HDIR/styles 
     patch < $NSROOT/install/patch-latex2html-2002-2-styles

     $L2HDIR will probably be something like /usr/share/latex2html.  For me it
     was /usr/local/share/lib/latex2html.

[OUTDATED: TURN OFF CALLS TO THE SEARCH ENGINE INSTEAD.]

 6. Get and build the search engine (ESSEX).

     Make a directory you want ESSEX to live in, lets call it $ESSEX, and 
     cd to it.
    
     wget http://br.endernet.org/~akrowne/elaine/essex/release/essex-latest.tar.gz
    
     (or similar).  Customize $ESSEX/server/config.h (it
     is safe to leave the default values).  Then make:
    
      cd $ESSEX/server
      ./make

 7. Build the page image hyperlink mapper [errors, can't find magick/api.h]:

     cd $NSROOT/bin/map
     make

 8. Make sure the "data" working directories are writeable by the user that 
    Noosphere is running as:
 
     chgrp -R www-data $NSROOT/data/cache
     chmod -R g+sw $NSROOT/data/cache

     chgrp -R www-data $NSROOT/data/cache
     chmod -R g+sw $NSROOT/data/cache

 9. Install the background tasks needed by Noosphere.  Lines similar to the 
    following should be added to the crontab of the user Noosphere is running
    as:

     */10 * * * * $NSROOT/bin/renderall >/dev/null
     */5 * * * * $NSROOT/bin/cleansearchresults >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
     37 * * * * $NSROOT/bin/outstandingcor >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
     00 8 * * * $NSROOT/bin/cleantemp >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
     45 * * * * $NSROOT/bin/spelld_rehash.sh


     */10 * * * * /home/noosphere/noosphere-read-only/noosphere/bin/renderall >/dev/null
     */5 * * * * /home/noosphere/noosphere-read-only/noosphere/bin/cleansearchresults >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
     37 * * * * /home/noosphere/noosphere-read-only/noosphere/bin/outstandingcor >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
     00 8 * * * /home/noosphere/noosphere-read-only/noosphere/bin/cleantemp >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
     45 * * * * /home/noosphere/noosphere-read-only/noosphere/bin/spelld_rehash.sh
    
    The script $NSROOT/bin/cleantemp must be changed so that point to
    
     $NSROOT/data/cache/temp/

10. Set one-time tasks to initialize at system startup.  Inspect the file 

     $NSROOT/bin/init.sh 

     You will need to make changes to this file in terms
     of paths, and probably want to put it in one of your
     /etc/init.d/ scripts (or similar, depending on your
     distribution) e.g. call it from
     /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh

11. Install vim color syntaxing script:

     cp $NSROOT/stemplates/pm.vim /usr/share/vim/vim61/colors/ (or similar)

 And that should be it!

Section 3 : Configuration 
=========================

 For configuration, please direct your attention to (in this order):
 
[cp /home/noosphere/noosphere-read-only/noosphere/etc/httpd-example.conf /var/www/noosphere/etc/httpd-example.conf]

  1. $NSROOT/etc/httpd-example.conf 

     This is a sample of an Apache/modperl setup for
     Noosphere (the one that is used at PlanetMath).  It
     would be included in the main Apache httpd.conf
     (i.e. /etc/apache2/httpd.conf) with a line like:

      Include /var/www/noosphere/etc/httpd-example.conf

     You probably want to rename it to something more meaningful to your own 
     project, and tool around with the values therein.  You do not need this 
     many virtual hosts, so it is safe to pare down the configuration to a 
     single virtualhost which has the mod_perl interface.

	 The _SITE variables are not restricted to just being domain names, they
	 can have paths, for example IMAGE_SITE could be "foo.com/~bar/images".

     Of course, the directories will all need to be changed to conform to your
     own $NSROOT.

  2. $NSROOT/etc/essex.conf.example

     This configures the search engine.   You'll have to change the paths in 
     this file to point to $NSROOT/bin. 

	 Also edit $NSROOT/bin/start_searchengine.sh to point to the 
	 location of your ESSEX excutable (i.e. $ESSEX/server).

  3. $NSROOT/lib/Noosphere/baseconf-example.pm

	 Copy this to baseconf.pm in the same dir, and edit that.

     This is the lowest-level config for Noosphere.  In here you will need to
     set BASE_DIR to $NSROOT as well as enter in your database configuration.

     IMPORTANT: You must set a value for the "HASH_SECRET" constant in this 
	 file.  This will be used for security purposes.  You can use any source 
	 you'd like to generate this string, but it should be as random as 
	 possible.  

     Also here, select whether you have support for classification schemes.

     Note that the database here is the one you set up in
     step 3 in the previous section.

  4. $NSROOT/lib/Noosphere/Config.pm

     This is where most of the logic-level (as opposed to
     presentation-level) configuration is done.  There is
     a lot in here, but most of what needs to be changed
     is near the top.

     The part you'll have to think hardest about are the
     entry types, since the ones in there are geared
     towards mathematics in specific.

  5. $NSROOT/stemplates/*

     (Suggested) 

     These templates are what PlanetMath uses.  I imagine that some people will
     want their own look-and-feel, as not much thought or time went into the 
     graphic design of PlanetMath.  Be aware that the actual names of the 
     template files aren't necessarily the most useful or consistent, so if you 
     want to make a specific change to some particular page on the site, it may
     help to simply grep for some unique string on that page in order to find
     the right template file.  If you don't find anything, then you'll probably
     have to dig into the code (which contains a fair amount of the form pages 
     inline).

     Of course, if you dont want to change the look and feel, you can basically
     skip this (other than changing the IMG SRC for the site logo icon.)

	 Some of the first template files you might want to attack:

	 - header.html
	 - main.html
	 - frontpage.xsl
	 - mainmenu.xsl
	 - about.html
	 - feedback.html

     Note: the templates situation is pretty awful now, as the evolution from
     HTML templates to XSL templates is not complete, and CSS is not heavily 
     used.  Hopefully this will be fixed at some point in the future 
     ( volunteers? =) )

  6. $NSROOT/lib/Noosphere/Layout.pm

     (Suggested)

     Since the codebase has not yet been entirely XSLT-ized, this perl 
     module is still needed.  It contains some presentation-layer routines that
     you probably want to modify if you are changing the global colourscheme or
     motif.  In the future this should be CSS-ized, then eliminated when it is
     XSLT-ized.

 Hopefully this will all be changing extensively soon, as more of the math (and
 PlanetMath) specific parts of Noosphere are pulled out of the core system and
 made into explicit configuration.

Section 4 : Starting Up
=======================

1. Start up the search engine and other miscellaneous Noosphere services.  As root,
   run

    $NSROOT/bin/init.sh

2. Start up apache with your Noosphere instance added to the configuration, as 
   above.  

    apache2ctl restart

And you should be in business, with no hitches whatsoever! (yeah right)

Section 5 : Getting Help
========================

 If something goes wrong, send a note to akrowne@gmail.com, pebbler@gmail.com,
 or as a last resort holtzermann17@gmail.com...

 For instant gratification, you should log on to IRC.   Help can be found in
 #planetmath, on server br.endernet.org or dominia.endernet.org.
